- en: Mastering Ethereum development starts with a lot of theory and technicality,
    but, at some point you'll have to take the leap in order to start applying your
    recently-acquired knowledge on real-world scenarios that build your portfolio.
    That's why we're going to create a blockchain-based social media platform, since
    it's one of the best use cases of blockchain technology, given that we provide
    people with trust. Unfortunately, many centralized social media companies are
    abusing that trust by stealing and monetizing users' privacy. Social media platforms
    such as Twitter or Facebook are famous because they give people the power to stay
    in touch with many individuals in one single interface that takes advantage of
    the internet's capabilities.

    media platform that lives entirely on the blockchain without centralized servers.
    You will understand how to create a beautiful user interface with React. Then
    you'll explore how to organize the information better so that you allow people
    to find the content that they want using smart contracts. Finally, you'll tie
    everything together using web3 and you'll be able to use your social media platform.

    dynamically with our state data. Finally, the `render()` function is displaying
