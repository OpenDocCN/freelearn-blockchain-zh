    the evolution of a new economic and manufacturing revolution. **Industry 4.0**
    is a concept that takes place in an era of new methods, technologies, and unprecedented
    computing capabilities that can be used by anyone who has internet access.

    model where connectivity and data collection and processing are widely applied
    throughout an entire manufacturing chain.

    it can be understood as the creation of new manufacturing models designed to create
    more personalized and engaging experiences. The new model emphasizes that having
    data is a key factor for success, and new business models are being created at
    the intersection of current business models. Cloud computing, the IoT, cognitive
    computing, and blockchain are some of the technologies that have been driving
    this new model.

    well as providing tooling to redesign existing ones. Cloud computing creates simple,
    self-service, flexible, and low-cost infrastructure for a highly technological
    and innovative ecosystem of services. More than processing capability, the role
    of cloud computing is to become an innovation platform. Let's dive into the world
    of cloud computing to understand its relation and importance to Industry 4.0 development.

    memory, calculation, networking, and storage capabilities, to run applications.
    The characteristics that define a computing model as a cloud model include self-service
    resource allocation, software-defined resources, and pay-as-you-go monetization.
    These are usually presented in three models of commercialization: **Infrastructure
    as a Service** (**IaaS**), **Platform as a Service** (**PaaS**), and **Software
    as a Service** (**SaaS**). Furthermore, they can be delivered into public and
    private models of deployment:'

    for maintaining networking, storage, servers, and virtual machine components.
    Every layer above that, including its licenses, backups, updates, and upgrades,
    are the responsibility of the party that contracted the service.

    capabilities, giving the service consumer more abstraction on infrastructure and
    software license management; the only layers they have to deal with are the application
    code and binaries and data used by it.'

    such as the internet, it's called a public cloud—a place where a person and a
    company share the same resources. When a company or a person uses any of these
    models in a single-tenant environment in a private or public network, it is called
    a private cloud.

    hard path to follow to make a solution available to its customers. They had to
    buy servers; wait for delivery; provision space in their data centers; prepare
    networking and virtualization; install operation systems, middleware, databases,
    and runtimes; and then develop applications and deploy them to the production
    environment.

    have expected results leading to constant changes in infrastructure, platform
    software and attached services. What if the MVP created does not fit target users
    need? In the first scenario, you already paid for all the resources you needed,
    so even if you shut down the solution, you already spent capex. However, in the
    second scenario (cloud), you paid for the service, so it's just opex. What if
    the solution had a great fit and people are using it a lot? In the first scenario,
    you have to follow an easier (but still hard) path to provision more resources,
    while in cloud computing, you can scale the solution resources whenever they are
    needed, not all the time.

    applications using best-of-breed services and technologies such as the IoT, cognitive
    computing, blockchain, and other services that are created and delivered on the
    internet. Those services are powerful tools to create new solutions and business
    models, providing a differentiated experience to clients whether there are 1,
    10, 100, or 1 million people using the same service.

    a lean industry is meant to focus only on things that have value to the target
    client of the product. Whatever procedure, part of the product, or process that
    creates it that does not provide value to the product is considered useless and
    must be removed or changed so it adds more value to the end-to-end solution. With
    the same approach, smart business models tend to only have steps that add value
    and knowledge to the business model, which means that outsourcing is still a big
    deal in this area. Becoming lean is not easy and cheap if you don't know how to
    integrate the end-to-end service chain into the business.
