- en: Blockchain-based apps, in addition to cryptocurrencies, are being developed
    in a variety of industries, including banking, the supply chain, and healthcare,
    in order to achieve digital transformation and enhance the user experience. Blockchain
    is not only about Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, but also about different technologies,
    such as peer-to-peer networks, consensus mechanisms, and cryptography. These technologies
    together help to sustain trustless environments in which digital value can be
    transferred between individuals without intermediaries.

- en: This book will help you understand the basics of blockchain, including cryptographic
    methods, hash functions, and consensus mechanisms. You will then focus on how
    blockchain is used today in different industries and the technological challenges
    faced while implementing a blockchain strategy. The book will also enable you,
    as a decision maker, to understand blockchain from a technical perspective and
    evaluate its applicability in business. Finally, you'll get to grips with cloud-based
    solutions and blockchain frameworks, such as Hyperledger and Quorum, and how to
    use them.

- en: '[Chapter 1](c15da2bc-7e16-4fbe-9e6b-c76ea35ea5fb.xhtml), *Basics of Blockchain
    and the Illustration of Village Beta*, aims to provide the reader with a straightforward
    example in terms of understanding how blockchain truly works and how it can apply
    to real-life situations. It provides a brief introduction as to why blockchain
    is a genuine matter for C-level executives and gives an illustration of how it
    operates.'

    into Blockchain*, includes a description of the components of blockchain, as well
    as a description of those stakeholders who compose a blockchain network, before
    describing a block and its data structure, the hash, the previous hash, the nonce,
    and the timestamp. We''ll then describe hash functions and their role in blockchain
    as well as discover how cryptography plays an important role in managing identities
    in the network and identifying stakeholders to provide authentication. We''ll
    introduce symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods and the underlying pairs
    of keys tied to each account (private and public). We''ll explain consensus mechanisms
    and illustrate the Byzantine Generals Problem, which is the first computer science
    problem to raise questions regarding consensus in a network in the presence of
    traitors or faults. We''ll eventually go through an explanation of how the network
    keeps working to achieve truth thanks to game theory and economics.'

    Contracts*, introduces Ethereum, a decentralized platform running like an operating
    system to build decentralized applications. We''ll describe the components of
    Ethereum, its Ethereum Virtual Machine, which acts as a computer program, its
    *fuel*, referred to as gas, and its smart contracts, which can trigger actions
    automatically in respect of their code. We''ll explain why Ethereum is so successful,
    how it differs from Bitcoin, and focus on their underlying consensus mechanisms.
    We''ll finally end the chapter by understanding Ethereum''s roadmap to a more
    scalable and efficient infrastructure and discover a number of real-world applications
    built on Ethereum.'

    Fundraising Methods*, explain these new token-based fundraising methods, which
    generate new cryptocurrencies that are sold against other already existing liquid
    money. We''ll understand the current success of ICOs and why they are so risky,
    both for investors and project leaders. We''ll illustrate a number of ICOs, including
    Ethereum and the DAO, and differentiate between utility tokens from security tokens
    as well as introduce legal concerns from regulatory bodies.'

    in relation to blockchain, ICOs and cryptocurrencies. While China was initially
    extremely cautious, the US attempted to legally define ICOs and provide a regulatory
    framework. Europe is adopting a wait-and-see approach, while there is a genuine
    need for entrepreneurs to be overseen and helped by public institutions.'

    cover several issues, including trustworthiness in official releases, interoperability
    between IT systems, traceability within supply chains, automation and disintermediation
    thanks to smart contracts, digital identity management, public and governmental
    challenges, tokenization in the financial industry, and finally, digital uniqueness.
