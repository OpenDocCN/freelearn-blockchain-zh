    Scientists foresaw a state where a quantum computer would be able to do a task
    that a classical computer could not. That is a very loose definition of quantum
    supremacy though. That is perhaps what allowed Google to claim that they have achieved
    quantum supremacy with their Sycamore chip.

    chip）已实现量子霸权的原因。

    The algorithm used to do that would take over 10,000 years to do the same task
    using a classical computer, whereas it took 200 seconds on the Sycamore. IBM had
    its objections to this claim. They calculated that the entire quantum state vector

    have a small number of qubits doing the calculations, and a large army of qubits

- en: In NISQ though, we use the noisy qubits to do the calculations. As these qubits
    are noisy, the time taken to perform calculations must be short. If the calculations
    are not quick, we may end up with error-prone results. Typically, this setup would
    involve a shorter circuit and no error-correcting qubits. The system is re-initialized

    times. Coherence time just refers to the span that quantum states can survive
    for. Traditionally, an approach called **quantum phase estimation** (**QPE**)
    has been used to simulate the time evolution of a wave function. Using QPE to
    perform calculations on chemical reactions was first envisaged by Aspuru-Guzik

    for future operational excellence. The chemical industry, much like the energy
    sector, can benefit a lot from such data-driven initiatives. An Accenture report
    in 2018 highlights the use of golden source of data using Blockchain for disaster
    recovery in the chemical industry. However, this use case is yet to be proven
    at scale.

- en: As we have noted in previous chapters, Blockchain applications are gaining traction
    in supply chain management, trade finance and smart cities. Any value chain where
    there is a need to manage and maintain the integrity of goods being produced,
    transported, and distributed is an excellent use case for Blockchain. However,
    it is still early days for the technology. It is a 12-year-old technology that
    will most certainly go through its winters.

  zh: 正如我们在前几章中所指出的，区块链应用在供应链管理、贸易融资和智慧城市领域正变得越来越受到关注。任何需要管理和保持生产、运输和分发商品完整性的价值链都是区块链的极好用例。然而，对于这项技术来说，现在还为时过早。这是一个12岁的技术，几乎肯定会经历它的寒冬。

  zh: 结论
- en: Deep technologies such as quantum computing and Blockchain can bring paradigm shifts
    in the way the chemical industry innovates and operates. Quantum computing use
    cases in chemistry are similar to those in healthcare, as they are largely about
    simulating and calculating chemical reactions using quantum algorithms and devices.

  zh: 深度技术，如量子计算和区块链，可以在化工行业创新和运营方式上带来范式转变。量子计算在化学中的应用案例与医疗保健中的类似，主要是利用量子算法和设备模拟和计算化学反应。
- en: There are two other key acceleration factors for chemistry applications of quantum
    computing. One is the aspect that molecules can be modeled more naturally within
    qubits using different circuitry. We saw trapped ion qubits that were more suitable
    for chemistry than superconductor qubit circuits. The other interesting aspect
    is the ability to use NISQ devices for chemistry. NISQ devices can be perfect
    for chemistry as noise can be used as a feature in modeling behaviors of molecules.

  zh: 对于量子计算化学应用来说，还有两个关键加速因素。一个是分子可以更自然地在量子位上使用不同的电路进行建模。我们看到困禁离子量子位比超导量子位电路更适合化学。另一个有趣的方面是利用NISQ设备进行化学研究的能力。NISQ设备对化学来说可能是完美的，因为噪声可以用作模拟分子行为的特征。
- en: This is not quite the case in quantum computing solutions for cryptography;
    therefore, in their ability to leverage noisy qubits, chemistry applications are
    special. We also touched upon the use of techniques like VQE that require lower
    coherence times. With all these aspects coming together, chemistry solutions can
    potentially be the first to be commercialized in the industry.

  zh: 在密码学的量子计算解决方案中，情况并非完全如此；因此，利用噪声量子位的能力，化学应用是特殊的。我们还提到了使用需要较低相干时间的VQE等技术。所有这些因素的综合作用下，化学解决方案有可能成为该行业中首批商业化的解决方案。
- en: With Blockchain, however, the chemical industry hasn't really woken up to the
    potential. When the data tracking and sharing happens on an immutable record,
    the impact it could have from a risk management and disaster recovery perspective
    can add a lot of value. We also touched upon why Blockchain ecosystems can be
    relevant in the chemicals industry as they help with the creation of bespoke supply
    chains for specific chemicals more easily.

  zh: 然而，化学行业对区块链的潜力还没有真正觉醒。当数据跟踪和共享发生在不可变记录上时，从风险管理和灾难恢复的角度来看，它可能带来的影响可以增加很多价值。我们还提到了为什么区块链生态系统在化学行业中可能相关，因为它们有助于更轻松地为特定化学品创建定制供应链。
- en: There are many opportunities in this industry, for those who can develop solutions
    to move beyond current limitations. There are technology barriers to be overcome
    for such solutions to be mainstream. But the key takeaway is that, with the chemicals
    industry, quantum computing applications might perhaps get ahead of Blockchain
    ones. In the subsequent chapters, we will explore the risks that quantum computing
    could pose to cryptography.

  zh: 在这个行业中有很多机会，对于那些能够开发解决方案以超越当前限制的人来说。要使这些解决方案成为主流，需要克服技术障碍。但关键的要点是，对于化学品行业来说，量子计算应用可能会超前于区块链应用。在随后的章节中，我们将探讨量子计算可能对密码学造成的风险。
