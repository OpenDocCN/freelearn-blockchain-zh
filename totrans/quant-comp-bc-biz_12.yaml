    Scientists foresaw a state where a quantum computer would be able to do a task
    that a classical computer could not. That is a very loose definition of quantum
    supremacy though. That is perhaps what allowed Google to claim that they have achieved
    quantum supremacy with their Sycamore chip.

    The algorithm used to do that would take over 10,000 years to do the same task
    using a classical computer, whereas it took 200 seconds on the Sycamore. IBM had
    its objections to this claim. They calculated that the entire quantum state vector
    of Google's Sycamore chip could be stored within Summit – the world's largest
    supercomputer, with 250 petabytes of storage.

    about the speed of calculations. Despite the generic definition of quantum supremacy,
    it is more about the ability to model particle physics within a computer in a
    way that has never been done before. It is more about solving problems that we
    couldn't even model accurately within classical computers. On top of that, with
    quantum annealers, combinatorial optimization problems with interrelated variables

    increase crop yields. In the initial days, farmers were using natural manure such
    as animal faeces to improve crop production. It was in 1914 that the first synthetic
    fertilizers were used, and since then the industry has grown so much that, today,
    it accounts for 1.2% of global energy consumption.

    enzymes and convert Nitrogen (N[2]) into Ammonia (NH[3]). Nature makes it look very simple;
    in an industrial context however, it is not so straightforward.

    it must be reapplied to the soil. As a result, the consumption and demand for

    fertilizers.

    fertilizers? Could we replicate the reaction between Nitrogen and enzymes like
    nitrogenase in an industrial setup?

    of study for several quantum computing researchers across the world. It would
    help us reduce 2-3% of our CO[2] emissions, and eat our food guilt-free. Therefore,
    we will need to develop an understanding of nature's Nitrogen fixation process.

    electrons in the atoms and molecules of chemicals interact with each other during
    a reaction. Due to the fact that electron correlation influences the movement

    This impacts the outcome of chemical reactions and leads to simplified particle
    interaction modeling being inadequate. As a result, accurately predicting the
    results of chemical interactions is extremely hard. Highly accurate electronic

    the chemicals industry will also need to take a marketplace approach (not the
    marketplace business model) in sharing data with different stakeholders.

    ecosystem come together to create specific chemicals for certain specific purposes.
    Going back to our fertilizer example, it would make it a lot easier to be highly
    innovative and differentiated if a company at the heart of the value chain could
    collaborate with suppliers to create a proprietary fertilizer composition that
    might need bespoke tweaks to their supply chain.

    with Quantoz, a Blockchain company. They have set up a platform for **Internet
    of Things** (**IoT**)-driven payments that a few other stakeholders are also part of.
    The use of Blockchain in an ecosystem context is still in its early days within
    the chemicals industry. However, there are genuine opportunities to scale once
    a few pilots have proven the efficacy.

    It is essential to have end-to-end traceability and transparency of the supply
    chain that helps with the manufacturing, logistics, storage, and distribution
    of chemicals. Let's now look at the applications of Blockchain in disaster recovery
    of chemical plants.

- en: On December 2^(nd) 1984, the city of Bhopal in India faced a major disaster,
    which still haunts the local community. The Union Carbide pesticide plant released
    about 30 tonnes of toxic gas called methyl isocyanate. This gas mixed with the
    atmosphere and affected about 600,000 people living in neighboring towns and villages.
    Up to the present day, the death toll has been placed at 15,000 people, including
    both immediate fatalities and deaths over the years. Many people have lost their
    eyesight and those in the neighboring regions have faced health issues.

    and the accident, is yet to be performed. Human rights organizations still claim
    that there are several tonnes of chemicals buried underground, and the government
    of India have declared the site as contaminated. The chemicals industry, like
    the energy sector, has done wonders in helping the world solve several problems.
    However, when things go wrong, they go wrong badly.

    disaster recovery, it is essential to understand the impact of the chemicals.
    In the case of the Bhopal gas tragedy, let's quickly look at how Blockchain could
    have helped the disaster recovery mechanism.

    a Blockchain could be captured in a near-real-time registry. This would have allowed
    us to assess the quantity of chemicals that were being produced that could have
    been released into the air. Based on the quantity of chemicals tracked into the
    factory, and the amount left after the crisis, we would immediately be able to
    calculate the scale of the issue.

    immediate solutions can be devised in terms of the quantity and quality of medicines required
    for the affected. Due to the immutable nature of the register backed by Blockchain,
    we would also know what triggered the accident. Especially if we tracked the supply
    chain and the passage of raw materials and intermediate and final products through
    the manufacturing process, we would know where things went wrong.

    supply of raw materials can be tracked at the micro level, can be useful. With
    all this data tracked, it can help the audit and insurance process post-disaster.
    Auditors can make informed decisions on supply chain changes, operational process
    changes, and chemical process tweaks, and add governance and controls accordingly
    to ensure business continuity.

    for future operational excellence. The chemical industry, much like the energy
    sector, can benefit a lot from such data-driven initiatives. An Accenture report
    in 2018 highlights the use of golden source of data using Blockchain for disaster
    recovery in the chemical industry. However, this use case is yet to be proven
    at scale.

    in supply chain management, trade finance and smart cities. Any value chain where
    there is a need to manage and maintain the integrity of goods being produced,
    transported, and distributed is an excellent use case for Blockchain. However,
    it is still early days for the technology. It is a 12-year-old technology that
    will most certainly go through its winters.

    in the way the chemical industry innovates and operates. Quantum computing use
    cases in chemistry are similar to those in healthcare, as they are largely about
    simulating and calculating chemical reactions using quantum algorithms and devices.

    computing. One is the aspect that molecules can be modeled more naturally within
    qubits using different circuitry. We saw trapped ion qubits that were more suitable
    for chemistry than superconductor qubit circuits. The other interesting aspect
    is the ability to use NISQ devices for chemistry. NISQ devices can be perfect
    for chemistry as noise can be used as a feature in modeling behaviors of molecules.

    therefore, in their ability to leverage noisy qubits, chemistry applications are
    special. We also touched upon the use of techniques like VQE that require lower
    coherence times. With all these aspects coming together, chemistry solutions can
    potentially be the first to be commercialized in the industry.

    potential. When the data tracking and sharing happens on an immutable record,
    the impact it could have from a risk management and disaster recovery perspective
    can add a lot of value. We also touched upon why Blockchain ecosystems can be
    relevant in the chemicals industry as they help with the creation of bespoke supply
    chains for specific chemicals more easily.

    to move beyond current limitations. There are technology barriers to be overcome
    for such solutions to be mainstream. But the key takeaway is that, with the chemicals
    industry, quantum computing applications might perhaps get ahead of Blockchain
    ones. In the subsequent chapters, we will explore the risks that quantum computing
    could pose to cryptography.
