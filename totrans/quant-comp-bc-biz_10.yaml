    in the oceans flow in a three-dimensional pattern, namely east to west, north
    to south, and the surface to the depths. Winds in tropical oceans blow from east
    to west. As a result, coastal areas of land masses have a temperature gradient
    from east to west. For example, the western part of the pacific is 8°C warmer
    than the eastern part.

    gravity. When this warm pattern of weather moves eastwards to the coastal areas
    of South America, we see the El Niño effect.

- en: El Niño causes the North Western part of South America to heat up. As the warmest
    part of the oceans' surface generates the most evaporation, we see tropical storms
    move eastwards too. This affects weather patterns across the earth. The El Niño
    effect happens once every few years, and scientists haven't been able to predict
    it accurately.

- en: The earth's tilt has an impact on the atmospheric circulation of winds. Thanks
    to the tilt, the air on the surface is deflected. The deflected air flows to the
    right of its initial trajectory in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa in
    the southern hemisphere. The earth's revolution in its orbit around the sun creates
    climate cycles.

    from 21.5° to 24.5°. As the tilt affects the solar input, ocean currents and atmospheric
    circulation, it has a marked effect on climate cycles.

    the climate of the earth, it is hard to model climate patterns meaningfully using
    classical computing methods. Quantum computers should have the ability to deal
    with the data requirements to model climate change. The first step needs to be
    about determining conclusively that climate change is being caused by human actions.

    for environmental modeling. Modeling nature can be better done by quantum computers
    because nature is effectively quantum mechanical. To do this in a classical computer
    requires the translation of physics into computer science before loading it up
    into the computer. In a quantum computer, physics is encoded in its native state.
    There is no translation and so no loss of information in the process. Therefore,
    simulating its behavior should be more accurate with a quantum computer.

    should be great tools to model physics. Aside from the improvement in the crunching
    abilities of the quantum computer, the fact that it mimics nature allows for better
    modeling of nature's behavior, if properly utilized.

    change puzzle using quantum computers. As quantum machine learning and annealing
    processes go mainstream, there will be several solutions that we will use daily
    to understand the impact we have upon the environment. We will be able to predict
    weather conditions better and more effectively manage extreme conditions.

- en: The application of quantum machine learning and annealing techniques within
    smart cities and climate modeling is still at a very early stage. In comparison
    to financial services and healthcare applications, these applications are still
    well behind. While smart city applications of emerging technologies can perhaps
    wait, it is critical that we get a firm understanding of climate change.

    phenomena affecting our lives, and the lives of future generations. It is imperative
    that policy makers leverage technologies such as quantum computers to drive decision-making
    at the highest levels. A top-down approach to climate change will help us as citizens
    to combat the long-term effects of human action on our planet.

    healthcare, financial services, and smart cities. In the coming chapters, we will
    look at its applications in logistics, which struggles with some of the hardest
    problems to solve using classical computers. We will also look at quantum-resistant
    ledgers, which can be used by the Blockchain community to be quantum-ready.
