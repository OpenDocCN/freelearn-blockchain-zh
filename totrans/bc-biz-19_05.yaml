    term you've probably heard plenty of times over the last year or so. This sounds
    a bit mysterious, or, a bit… cryptic… doesn't it? Many of you have probably heard
    the word **cryptography**, but how many actually know what it involves?

    in order to secure private information from being accessed by unauthorized third
    parties who can potentially act in bad faith. The process involves two main steps:'

    generals. His technique was simple by today's standards; he used letters that
    were three positions away in the alphabet after the intended letter. For example,
    the letters ABC would be represented by DEF. In fact, this encryption method is
    widely known as the **Caeser cypher**.

    significance, was the Enigma machine invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius
    at the end of World War I. It was commercialized in the early 1920s and the German
    army adopted it soon after, in order to secure its military communications. The
    Enigma machine has nearly 159 Quintilian different combinations of characters
    and numbers (more precisely 158,962,555,217,826,360,000). The Enigma cypher was
    considered unbreakable at the time and gave an edge to the German army during
    World War II. However, a team led by the brilliant English mathematician and early
    computer science pioneer, Alan Turing, managed to crack the Enigma code, which
    helped the Allies win the war. These events were recreated in the 2014 film, *The
    Imitation Game*. We'll come across further references to the genius of Alan Turing
    and his impact on modern computer science in [Chapter 9](1e88e8a6-ca55-4c21-be7b-173404a98d5a.xhtml),

    basically secret pieces of information or parameters, which typically look like
    strings of characters. Think about something such as a password or passphrase
    that locks and unlocks access to an encrypted message. These are actually keys
    to the cryptographic algorithms and help convert ordinary information (called
    **plain text**) into unintelligible text (called **ciphertext**) and vice versa.
    This is shown in the following diagram:'

    to provide security and privacy in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Actually,
    the Bitcoin blockchain is the largest civilian deployment of public key encryption
    technology in the world. Only the US Department of Defense makes a larger use
    of such technology, which says a lot about its merits.

    be familiar with how keys work. Each user has a pair of keys (a public and a private
    one), which enable transactions on the network. You can see some examples of public
    and private key pairs in Bitcoin in the following screenshot:'

- en: The **public key** is used by the sender to encrypt information regarding the
    transaction, which then can be decrypted only by the receiver with his or her
    corresponding **private key**. The public address, which acts like an account,
    can only receive funds, and is derived from the public key and can be shared openly.
    The private key must be stored securely and never disclosed as it, and only it,
    gives access to the user's funds on the blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the private key is lost, access to the funds is lost permanently. There is
    no such thing as a password reset function on the blockchain. Users need to take
    responsibility for storing and backing up their private keys properly, because
    there is no central authority on the network that can reverse misplaced transactions
    or restore private keys. You need to be sure that you understand the implications
    of any loss of private keys and take all the possible measures to avoid it. You
    should treat the private keys for your Bitcoin or another cryptoasset with the
    same care you treat any physical cash, gold, or diamonds you may have. The difference
    here is that you can back up your private key, as it is a string of characters
    that can be copied. Therefore, you can print it on paper, save it on a USB memory
    stick, or use special devices called hardware wallets, such as Ledger or Trezor,
    that can securely store your private key.

    other blocks may have 500 transactions, and others may have 1,000 transactions.
    All these transactions also typically vary in the size of the information they
    contain in terms of kilobytes. The only capacity limit in the Bitcoin blockchain
    protocol is on the size of each block, which has been 1 megabyte since 2010\.
    It was recently amended to effectively 1.4 MB with the latest upgrade of the Bitcoin
    software. But again, block sizes can vary up to that limit. You can check for

    which are an efficient way to secure data integrity and reduce file size. Hash
    functions are used to convert input data of any length into a compressed unique
    fixed length string of characters (also known as a bit string). This output data
    serves as a unique reference code or digital fingerprint to verify the authenticity
    of some underlying dataset without the need to actually check the entire dataset.

    of arbitrary size to a bit string of a fixed size (also known as a hash). It is
    designed to be a one-way function, meaning a function which cannot be inverted
    and recalculated backward to get to the input data. This can be seen in the following

    a brute-force search of all possible inputs to see if they produce a match. A
    brute-force search is basically systematically trying all possible combinations

- en: Another important cryptographic technique used in Bitcoin are digital signatures.
    They are used for authentication of the origin of transactions on the blockchain.
    They enable the receiver to verify that the transaction received was originally
    sent by the sender using his or her private key. This process again includes mathematical
    calculations. Surprise, surprise!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Basically, the digital signature is generated out of the sender's private key
    being processed through a digital signature algorithm. The resulting code output
    is then attached to the signed message and acts like a signature. It designates
    the sender of the message. Each transaction will have a different digital signature,
    which is generated through the digital signature algorithm to increase security.
    It is impossible to generate a valid signature for a party without knowing that
    party's private key.

    because transactions on the blockchain are basically messages broadcasted through
    the network. When you send cryptocurrency to another person, you are basically
    sending them a message.

    they cannot be intercepted and modified or reproduced while in transit.

    transaction message and used for a different message given that the algorithm
