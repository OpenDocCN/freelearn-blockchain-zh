    and a constantly growing database. Blockchain is a chronological ledger that records
    transactions of any value or asset securely. The blockchain network provides the
    ability to transfer any type of value or asset between independent parties using
    a peer-to-peer network. The initial objective of the blockchain technology was
    to establish trusted financial transactions between two independent parties without
    any involvement of third-parties such as a bank; however, later, several industries
    adopted blockchain to streamline their supply-chain process, KYC system, data
    management, and so on. With the growing use of online services and a growing number
    of online transactions, users have to trust and depend on third parties such as
    banks and payment gateway providers. This led to the birth of the blockchain.

    one party to another without going through financial institutions. One of the
    major addressed challenges was about the double method, which is used to avoid
    the double spending (a unique problem with digital currency is the risk of reproducing
    the same amount, even after spending it) of Bitcoin. As Bitcoin is digital money
    and it isn''t difficult to copy digital data and announce it, double-spending
    occurred and a solution was proposed to prevent this—this was blockchain. However,

    information over TCP/IP and the **Open Systems Interconnection** (**OSI**) model
    stack. From the birth of the internet, every new technology had disrupted an existing
    one, whether it was email or the web, or even e-commerce. The internet is one
    of the strongest technologies that has been powerful enough to spread out ideas
    to impact and create illusions for reality.

    between similar networks; however, the OSI model was developed by the **International
    Standard Organization** (**ISO**) to provide a framework to standardize communication
    between systems, irrespective of the vendors, models, and technologies. Organizations
    preferred both models for client/server communication because client/server networks
    tend to be much more reliable and stable in nature. It was important to have to
    a better control over what data customers were using and how they were using it.
    In a client/server model, a client manages their own local resources, such as
    hardware and software components of a workstation or any device, whereas a server
    is a highly powerful system that manages shared resources such as hardware, network
    communication channels, and databases. With a peer-to-peer network, there is no
    central authority to monitor, control, and enforce. Although small businesses
    used to prefer this for their internal needs, big organizations have always been
    away from peer-to-peer networks because of the risk of losing control over their
    business operation and management.

    given length of input string. The output is named hash or message digest, and
    is designed to protect the integrity of any kind of data, such as a file, media,
    or text. Only one message digest is assigned to protect a specific input or sensitive
    information. A small change made to the input data results in a drastic difference
    in the result, which makes it almost impossible to predict the data either in-motion
    or even at-rest. There are various ways to produce the hash or the message digest.

    any of its content. In the world of blockchain, hashing is the backbone of its
    immutability characteristic. The hashing process ensures that none of the blocks
    in the ledger are altered or tampered with. Instead of keeping track of each transaction's
    details such as `Mike pays $20 to John on July 20, 2017`, `Kevin Legal document
    has been received dated September 21, 2017`, and `Tom has completed a trip from

    anyone to tamper or alter the ledger except in the case of a hacker, who is capable
    enough of infecting and compromising all of the millions of nodes in the blockchain

    and making everyone agree to a desired policy is beneficial in avoiding any fraud
    attempts. This gave birth to the consensus mechanism, which is similar to the
    signaling process, to ensure that everything has been considered before actual
    communication is started. The following are four key methods that are used to
    achieve consensus with blockchain:'

- en: '**PoW**: One of the most popular methods to achieve consensus in blockchain
    was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin. In this type of consensus,
    fraud attempt is avoided based on the fundamentals of trusting a particular node
    that has been created to do maximum computational work. The block owner, also
    known as a **miner** in the world of cryptocurrency, knows that having powerful
    computational resources can achieve a better hash rate, and the chances of getting
    rewarded with Bitcoin increases. A new transaction is broadcast to all the nodes
    in the network, and each node keeps listening to these transactions. Nodes that
    want to gain incentives through bitcoin are known as miners, but they don''t just
    listen, they collect transactions. Miners have to solve some complex mathematical
    problems with a PoW algorithm. The one who solves it first gets rewarded with
    Bitcoin. Finally, verified blocks are added to the blockchain of every miner.'

    nodes and to validate transactions. Unlike PoW, with PoS, the block generator
    will not be selected based on its current stack of wealth. Blocks are never rewarded
    in this mechanism, and the miner in PoS is called a **forger**. Ethereum uses
    PoS, and the purpose of choosing this was to avoid any environmental pressures
    that come with a huge amount of electricity consumption. According to the Digiconomist
    report 2017, the power consumed by an entire Bitcoin network was estimated to
    be more than that of the Republic of Ireland. Bitcoin uses the PoW mechanism,
    and it is all based on miners with powerful resources, which results in more consumption
    of electricity. With the PoS mechanism, nodes have to join a validator pool to
    be selected as a forger. **Casper**, an Ethereum consensus PoS protocol, works
    as a hybrid version with an existing PoW mechanism. An Ethereum runs every 100th
    block. PoS is well-suited for a platform with a static coin supply, and many use
    this to distribute tokens against investment.'

    in a distributed environment. The idea is simply to avoid complete dependency
    over a single entity to store and manage a user's personal and business data.
    In the current database system, once data is stored online, the client has no
    information about how the data has been stored, what security prevention measures
    have been taken, who can read the data, and so on. Ethereum provides a platform
    to build distributed applications that connect each stack holder or party directly
    to achieve better transparency and zero-dependency. Even with the fundamental
    similarities between both Bitcoin and Ethereum, both notably differ in the purposes
    and capabilities. With Ethereum, any centralized services can be transformed to
    decentralized services with its unique programming capability. There are basically
    three layers of Ethereum—The **Ethereum Virtual Machine** (**EVM**), the cryptocurrency
    ether, and gas.

    secrets, intellectual property, and customer information. Every organization uses
    some form of cybersecurity solution, and yet billions of dollars are lost every
    year. Blockchain is designed to be decentralized, immutable, and traceable, and
    it solves most of the security challenges at the core. Some of its use cases are

    from the foundation layer. With the Ethereum blockchain, organizations can now
    easily leverage the benefits of distributed applications, similar to the efforts
    needed to turn-up traditional web applications. We also learned about the systematic
    programming of smart contracts and integrating them with the Ethereum blockchain.
