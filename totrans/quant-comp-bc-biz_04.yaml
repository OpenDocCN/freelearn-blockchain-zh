- en: The financial services industry has historically been slow in embracing innovation
    and cutting-edge technology. It is partly because banks, asset management, and
    insurance firms have seen themselves as being in the business of providing financial
    products. They have considered technology as cost centers and non-core to their
    business. However, that approach has been challenged by two key changes in the business
    landscape.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The recession in 2008 saw several key shifts in how financial services firms
    interacted with innovative technologies. Banks had huge regulatory pressures after
    the recession. This meant they had to be careful about how creative they got with
    financial products they were offering to their customers. Banks had to report
    more details to the regulators about their product and service offerings. As a
    result, innovative products became scarce. There were large overheads related
    to back office technology and processes. In the UK alone, £5 billion is spent
    by banks every year on regulatory compliance. With the increase in regulatory
    pressures came a surge in risk management processes and technology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other shift in the landscape was the rise of financial technology firms
    termed as *FinTechs*. FinTechs were innovative young companies that were using
    digital methods to offer financial services in a more customer-centric fashion.
    They were young and didn't have the burden of legacy technologies. This helped
    them create new business models, technology solutions, and operating models in
    a very short time span.

    the nimble FinTechs blindsided them. Before they realized it, banks saw their
    top line challenged by FinTechs that were growing fast and increasing their customer
    base. On the other hand, regulatory processes were creating bottom-line pressures.
    The solution was for financial services firms to turn technology into a competitive
    advantage.

    such as AI and Blockchain with varying degrees of success. In this chapter, I

    and touch upon some of the industry applications that are the right fit for this
    technology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As banks were grappling with the FinTech force, they wanted a silver bullet
    to solve the problem. Blockchain was introduced just after the FinTech hype took
    off, and banks latched on to the technology for several reasons. One was to create
    a perception that they could embrace innovation and lead with technology. They
    also felt Blockchain could bring them massive operational efficiencies across
    several banking processes. Blockchains are being experimented with in banks for
    processes from the onboarding of a customer, where **Know Your Customer** (**KYC**)
    checks would be made for the real-time settlement of a transaction. This would
    eventually be their competitive advantage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As banks explored ways of combating the FinTech challenge with emerging technologies,
    there were ecosystems created on Blockchain across the world. These ecosystems
    had the potential to challenge the very fundamentals of the traditional capital
    markets. The Blockchain ecosystems wave rode on the principles of decentralizing
    financial services. The capital markets that we have today are highly centralized,
    disintermediated, and are often inaccessible to people that need them the most.
    Blockchain was going to change all that and provide financial inclusion at scale.
    At least, that was the vision. This posed another major challenge to banks.
  prefs: []

    was trialed in and areas where there were success stories. Financial services
    are an industry that is inherently complex due to the business models and interactions
    across the globe. The data complexities involved within several banking functions
    require technologies that can help make the most of the data. Hence, it is also
    important to discuss the impact that quantum computing could have on financial
    services.

    The role of the field is to look at the financial positions that the firm has
    taken in the market and assess the risks around these. After the recession of
    2008, banks were mandated to hold reserve capital that is calculated based on
    risks associated with a portfolio. The **Value-at-Risk** (**VaR**) methodology

    trading positions. A bank can take positions in various products traded in the
    market. Every product has a pricing mechanism. The role of the risk management

    is priced by discounting future cash flows using an interest rate. The cash flow
    is generally fixed in the form of a coupon payment, and the variable used to discount
    the cash flow is an interest rate. The price of the bond can be calculated by
    using the interest rate data that is sourced from firms like Bloomberg. As the
    interest rate is used to discount cashflows, if the value of the interest rate
    goes up, the bond price comes down, and vice versa.

    go up, the price of the bond falls. Therefore, the market risk of a bond position

    the interest rates used. This is a simple example.

    When there are multiple risk factors affecting these variables, it makes it computationally

    to change. These interactions need to be modelled to price the product and the
    risks associated with positions.

    and ensure that the front office takes a hedging position to reduce the overall

    computations and simulations, and cutting-edge data analytics.

    engines every day. These positions are re-priced on a daily basis using market
    data, and risks are calculated by applying the risk factors to these re-priced
    positions. The correlation between these variables makes it harder for classical
    simulation techniques to assess the risks. As a result, banks sometime choose
    to approximate prices and hence the risk is also an approximation.

    However, in a crisis situation, when a bank finds itself dealing with an intra-day
    market disaster, existing systems and processes are severely lacking. They need
    to be able to price their risks quicker and at a higher level of accuracy, so
    that they can take necessary market actions. Understanding risks in a market stress

    British Airways. However, Brexit has an impact on the global economic outlook.
    On the day of the Brexit referendum, the price of oil along with several other
    commodities fell. A fall in oil prices is good news for airlines. Therefore, it
    is important to model the direct implication of a market risk on stock positions.

    before, portfolio optimization involves modelling the ideal allocation using several
    correlated variables. However, wouldn't it be easier if we were able to reduce
    the number of variables and have no correlations between them? That is exactly
    what PCA helps us with.

    for optimization, we can drop the least important variables in a portfolio. Each
    of the remaining variables used are independent of each other, which means correlations
    need not be explicitly modelled in. Describing PCA in more specific detail is
    beyond the scope of this book, but those who are interested can read more at [https://towardsdatascience.com/a-one-stop-shop-for-principal-component-analysis-5582fb7e0a9c](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-one-stop-shop-for-principal-component-analysis-5582fb7e0a9c).

    it has been demonstrated that the cost of performing the same computation is O(Log
    N)². This should help PCA go mainstream within financial services, as it massively

    As a customer, when I go to a bank to open a current account, the bank gets several
    documents from me to make sure I am who I say I am. All these documents are verified
    and stored in the bank's systems and files. Now, if I wanted to go for a mortgage
    with another bank, I must go through the same KYC processes. Sometimes, these
    processes take weeks as resources are spent to verify the identity of the customer.

    was about resolving the debt solution and evading issues with sanctions in Venezuela,
    it was more about accountability, transparency, and efficiencies in India. The
    RBI is exploring digital currency due to the unsustainable costs of printing and
    managing paper currency. 7 billion Indian Rupees (~$100 million) is spent every
    year on creating and managing the Rupee.

    *Introduction to Quantum Computing and Blockchain*. Here, we'll discuss what a
    security means in the eyes of a financial regulator like the **Security Exchange
    Commission** (**SEC**). The SEC uses the "Howey's Test" to assess whether something
    is a security or not. It was a test used by the Supreme Court in 1946 to rule
    a judgement on a real estate case and has since been used to identify securities.
