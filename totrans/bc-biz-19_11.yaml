    from the history of money and why blockchain cryptoassets make sense to the foundational
    technologies of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now that you have a good understanding of
    Bitcoin and Ethereum, which pioneered the first and second generation of this
    technology, we can move on and introduce some other interesting projects related
    to these technologies.

    categories, depending on who owns them and how accessible are they.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, we have public blockchains, which are open source projects, with free
    access for anyone to join the network and use it, support it, contribute to it,
    or build businesses on it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, we have private blockchains, which are not open source, and have restricted
    access to only users and entities who have been approved by the organization that
    owns and manages the network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In each of these categories, there are projects with general purpose blockchains
    such as Ethereum; however, there are also some application-specific blockchains
    present. General purpose technology is used to provide foundational infrastructure
    and building blocks to create applications on top of. For example, you can refer
    to pretty much any decentralized application based on Ethereum. With that said,
    it's essentially a one-size-fits-all toolbox.

- en: On the other hand, tailored blockchains or application-specific blockchains
    are blockchains with industry-specific use cases. They focus just on one sector
    or market, where they build innovative business models and provide solutions leveraging
    the strengths of blockchain technology. These blockchains focus on just one sector.
    That said, they can still be open source for everyone to access.

    It has an innovative business model, which provides incentives to users to contribute
    high quality content and to participate on the platform. These incentives come
    in Steem''s native cryptoassets, which are traded on exchanges and have real monetary
    value. There is a simple rationale for this: quality content increases traffic
    to the platform, thus bringing in more users. The more users a social media platform
    has, the more valuable it is. This is called a **positive network effect**. Therefore,
    members contributing high quality content or helping to curate content on the
    platform get their fair share of the value that''s created.'

    for blog posts and social commentary on specific topics. Like Medium, people can
    write and publish long blog posts, and like Reddit, they can share content and
    links from anywhere on the internet. Posts are upvoted, downvoted, and commented
    on by other users. The following diagram shows how Steem works in detail:'

    and streaming platform, similar to YouTube, built as an application on the Steem
    blockchain. The principles it operates on are the same as those of Steem: content
    contributors are rewarded in Steem''s native cryptoassets, but the focus is on
    video rather than blog posts. The main benefits of a decentralized YouTube are
    more fair value distribution among content creators and users, no annoying ads,
    and censorship resistance. The following diagram further explains DTube:'

    is probably in your pocket, your smartphone. Just like we have mass adoption of
    smartphones today (and remember that phones were not always smart), the vision
    of IoT is to have smart meters, smart grids, smart cars, smart homes, and even
    smart cities. The next generation of IoT devices includes smart electricity meters,
    which automatically send measurements of electricity usage by a house to the utility
    company for billing. This is part of the idea for smart homes, smart grids, and
    smart cities, where all sorts of home appliances and infrastructure can communicate
    with each other over the Internet and perform tasks autonomously. Other examples
    include wearable devices, heart monitoring implants, chips for tagging and monitoring
    animals, smart connected cars, and so on. Pretty much any physical object or device
    you can think of can be designed with some computational intelligence and Internet
    connectivity. IoT devices can have various sensors and technologies for collecting,
    measuring, and transmitting data, like the RFID chips that WaBi uses or the temperature
    sensors and Bluetooth that Modum uses.

    luxury goods, pharma, auto sector, logistics, shipping, and so on. They also tailor
    their solutions in slightly different ways, by using different types of sensors,
    general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum, or their own dedicated blockchains.
    However, the overall idea and business application are the same; they are all
    trying to deliver effective and efficient supply-chain management solutions through
    the convergence of IoT, blockchain, and smart contracts technologies. And this
    is a valid **unique selling proposition** (**USP**).

    such as the Internet and smartphones have brought unprecedented ease and speed
    to information discovery. Just like everything, these developments have their
    pros and cons. On the positive side, useful information, education, and knowledge
    can be spread quickly and empower people globally. People around the world who
    have traditionally been disadvantaged from information asymmetries now have the
    tools that can give them an equal opportunity to pursue their personal development
    goals and dreams. However, on the downside, the same technology can empower entities
    with dubious agendas to spy on people, like Big Brother in *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, George
    Orwell's classic dystopian novel published in 1949.

    private information and nobody is fully protected against that. It has happened
    to pretty much all big multinational banks, multibillion dollar corporations handling
    personal data such as Experian, tech giants, and even top security government
    agencies such as the **National Security Agency** (**NSA**). When there is a clear
    valuable target or central point of failure, hackers always find a way.

- en: Privacy is a desirable feature, not just for criminals, but also by regular
    people and businesses who don't want their personal and confidential information
    to be compromised and monetized by third parties. Given the transparency of public
    blockchains, many businesses may not feel comfortable to use them for conducting
    their operations. There is a lot of sensitive business information such as transactions
    with suppliers, quantities, and other private supply-chain details, as well as
    employee pay, which may not be appropriate to be stored on a transparent, public
    blockchain. Such information usually is kept as a trade secret, as it can be a
    source of important competitive advantage, after all.

    solutions have been in development to secure privacy and mitigate risks of personal
    data breaches. These solutions mostly revolve around cryptography. You probably
    remember our cryptography overview from [Chapter 5](84ad3021-fae1-4e16-aaae-cee34e5d2bf6.xhtml),
    *Five Forces of Bitcoin – #2 Cryptography*. Here, we''ll have a look at several
    blockchain cryptoassets, which have made advances in their privacy features beyond
    what Bitcoin offers. They focus, first and foremost, on delivering excellent privacy

    it is pseudo-anonymous, since all transactions can be seen by anyone using a block
    explorer like those we described earlier. Bitcoin transactions don't show usernames,
    but they show their public addresses, which can then be linked to the owners.
    This can be done at any point where users are required to do KYC, or otherwise
    disclose their identity, in order to transact. Such network nodes can include
    exchanges, other regulated financial institutions, airlines, e-commerce websites,
    or other merchants, which may accept payments in Bitcoin.

    to achieve with digital money. But when there is a problem and market demand,
    solutions are soon to follow. Hence, here come the privacy coins! Monero, ZCash,

- en: Monero is widely considered the digital currency with the strongest privacy
    features, thanks to its cryptography using ring signatures. Monero's cryptography
    is more complex than that of Bitcoin and most other cryptoassets, so we won't
    get into all the technical details. But to give you an idea, transactions in Bitcoin
    are digitally signed with personal cryptographic keys, so that anyone can see
    the addresses of the sender and the receiver, as well as the transaction amounts.
    This proves that the sender owns the money being transferred. It is similar in
    its purpose and effect to signing a check from your bank.

    verifier can''t tell which member actually produced the signature."'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, transactions in Monero appear to be signed by a large pool of users
    rather than a specific user. The ring signature only proves that the transaction
    was sent by someone in that pool, but it doesn't disclose exactly who. The Monero
    protocol allows for complete user privacy in terms of amounts, origins, and destinations
    for transactions, and it has a mechanism to prevent double-spending. In these
    features, it is similar to ZCash with its zero-knowledge proofs or zk-SNARKs,
    which we'll discuss next.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Launched in 2016, ZCash brought a new privacy technology to the blockchain market
    called zero-knowledge proofs with its zk-SNARKs protocol. ZCash provides optionality
    for users to either send regular transactions, like in Bitcoin, or to send private
    transactions where no information is revealed, other than that the transactions
    are valid. The project is led by Zooko Wilcox, who was previously part of David
    Chaums's DigiCash in the 1990s.

- en: DASH is another blockchain cryptoasset supporting private transactions. For
    this purpose, it uses a different protocol, which basically mixes many transactions
    together, to form kind of a large multiparty pooled transaction. In this way,
    it scrambles the different components of each transaction and makes it nearly
    impossible for an external observer to put the pieces together and figure out
    who sent what to whom.
