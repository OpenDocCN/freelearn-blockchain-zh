- en: Over the past 10 years, blockchain and its affiliated technologies have been
    used to add transparency and dis-intermediate unnecessary parties involved in
    critical processes. Along similar lines, AI has been adopted to optimize processes
    and predict outcomes in an accurate and cheap way. Together, AI and blockchain
    are catalyzing the pace of enterprise innovation. The convergence of these two
    technologies is expected to revolutionize some aspects of the digital landscape
    as we know it today. This book is a guide to help you understand the basic concepts
    of blockchain and AI, analyze their use cases, and implement these technologies
    across various industries such as healthcare, finance, trade, and supply chain
    management. The book also guides you to build applications using Ethereum, machine
    learning, and MóiBit.

    blockchain and AI, it would be helpful to be familiar with these technologies.
    Also, one of the learning outcomes for the book is to see how to build a DIApp,
    which combines the best of blockchain and AI. If you are interested in learning
    how to build a DIApp, you should be familiar with the basics of Solidity smart
    contracts, machine learning, and Python.
