    Ethereum, and the other projects discussed so far, mainly in one key aspect: access
    to the network. While in public blockchains, anyone can download some open source
    software, join the network, and use it, in private blockchains, access to the
    network is restricted. Corporations, government entities, or other organizations
    can build their own private blockchains to serve their business or administrative
    purposes. Such private blockchains are typically more centralized and much closer
    to a distributed database or ledger in their architecture and functions. This
    is because they don''t need a decentralized trust model like Bitcoin and other
    public blockchains.'

    use is widely accepted around the world. Most large international banks and other
    financial institutions have been developing their internal blockchain projects
    for a few years now. Established technology companies, such as IBM, have also
    joined the bandwagon. The same goes for shipping industry leaders, such as Maersk,
    that are interested in how blockchain can optimize their supply-chain management.
    These large corporations have found that the best way to develop their blockchain
    projects is to cooperate in industrial alliances, consortiums, or partnerships
    with each other. This may involve industry incubators where start-up teams collaborate
    with corporations to develop solutions for industrial use. Next, we'll have a

    blockchain infrastructure for the financial sector. It has grown to include over
    200 financial institutions in 2018\. Banks believe that blockchain technology
    could save them money by making their operations faster, more efficient, and more

    ledger technology** (**DLT**) platform, designed specifically for financial agreements
    between regulated financial institutions. The main difference between Corda and
    the public blockchains we are already familiar with, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum,
    is that Corda is based on consensus only between the parties to individual deals,
    rather than consensus of the entire network. Corda transactions are validated
    by parties to the transaction rather than a broader pool of unrelated validators.
    Therefore, the entire transaction database in Corda isn't copied to all network
    participants. This design also doesn't need a native cryptoasset to incentivize
    and reward miners to validate transactions, as the PoW consensus algorithm is
    unnecessary for private deployments. Corda's architecture directly enables regulatory
    and supervisory observer nodes. Distributed applications can be built on Corda
    using the **Java Virtual Machine** (**JVM**), which facilitates user adoption
    and interoperability with legacy systems.

    common buildings blocks can be reused in many different projects. Any component
    can be modified independently without affecting the rest of the system. Hyperledger

    is necessary. This is important because any corporate initiative to build a smart
    contract platform will have to import rules and transaction history data from
    existing databases. Most business information currently resides in the existing
    private databases of large and small companies. This would need to be integrated
    with the new emerging blockchain technology for the sake of business continuity
    and sustainability. For example, a bank would need to transfer associated its
    rules and history of loan recipients before it starts recording transactions and
    deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

    the importance of interoperability with the public Ethereum blockchain is also
    considered. Their vision is for Ethereum's public and private networks to function
    like the internet and corporate intranets. They will share standard protocols,
    such as for data storage and transmission, but will have different configurations
    for privacy and security, depending on each organization's needs.

    its public blockchain must include contributions from a diverse set of stakeholders.

    use: R3, Hyperledger, and EEA. Each has its own community of members, developers,
    and other contributors, and they all have their own version of foundational blockchain

    blockchain projects build upon, is that enterprise-grade blockchain solutions
    will operate in a trusted environment. This is due to the nature of how businesses
    tend to operate in the real world with known and endorsed partners. This premise
    has implications on the architecture of private permissioned blockchains, which
    is different from that of public permission-less blockchains such as Bitcoin and
    Ethereum. The game theory settings in these two scenarios are different.

    global problem – how to transfer value among unknown parties, without a need for
    the parties to trust each other, and without the presence of a central authority.
    In contrast, private blockchains take some of the innovations of public blockchains,

    and bring these to a familiar corporate environment of trusted business partners.

    interoperability, privacy, and governance, which their public peers have, but
    this is at the cost of less decentralization. They bring some of the benefits
    of public blockchains to the traditional setting of corporate walled gardens and
    restricted-access networks. But this creates single points of failure. What if
    a system administrator that's in charge of granting access to the corporate network
    gets hacked or otherwise corrupted? How many large corporations and government
    organizations have had their internal IT systems compromised in the past? The

    and supply chains, this would still have a mild effect in comparison to how public

    Private blockchains have their own merits in the current business environment
    and are being designed for user-friendly adoption by organizations in their present
    shape and form, without too much costly and unnecessary corporate restructuring.
    On the other hand, public blockchains have the potential to completely change
    the way business, as we know it, is done, and redesign the economic landscape.
    To reach that point, however, they will need to address some pressing issues limiting
    their development and mass user adoption. These are the issues we already mentioned,
    but it's worth repeating them because they are so critical: **scalability**, **interoperability**,
    **privacy**, and **governance**. There are a number of projects, currently in
    development, that are trying to resolve these issues. They are being advanced
    by the development teams of leading established public blockchains, such as Bitcoin
    and Ethereum, as well as by a bunch of new ambitious projects aiming to lead the
    next generation of blockchain technology.

    a business enterprise as we know it? If so, which public blockchains will be the
    winners? Will Bitcoin and Ethereum preserve their leadership or will they get
    replaced by a new competitor? Is it going to be a winner-takes-all game, or are
    we going to have a more decentralized landscape in line with the fundamental principle
    of this new technology? After all, we already have huge tech monopolies with unbelievable
    market power, such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Why does the world need to
    invent a great new decentralized way of doing things, just to replace the old
    corporate behemoths with new ones? How will the future business landscape look?

    useful example – electric vehicles are widely proclaimed as the future, but currently
    we have a market with traditional cars running on gas, electric cars, and hybrids.
