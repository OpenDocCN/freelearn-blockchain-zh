- en: '*Hands-On Blockchain Development in 7 Days* will teach you how to build an
    online gaming application using the Ethereum blockchain. Each section of the book
    will introduce fundamental blockchain programming concepts as they relate to creating
    an online game, followed by practical exercises that you can implement as homework
    assignments. With this book, you will gain core blockchain application development
    skills to do with creating smart contracts, interacting with the Ethereum network,
    building user interfaces, and deploying your application to the internet. This
    book supplies seven self-contained lessons taught in a practical, hands-on way.'
