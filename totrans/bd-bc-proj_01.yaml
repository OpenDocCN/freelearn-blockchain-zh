- en: Almost all of the Internet-based applications we have been using are centralized,
    that is, the servers of each application are owned by a particular company or
    person. Developers have been building centralized applications and users have
    been using them for a pretty long time. But there are a few concerns with centralized
    applications that make it next to impossible to build certain types of apps and
    every app ends up having some common issues. Some issues with centralized apps
    are that they are less transparent, they have a single point of failure, they
    fail to prevent net censorship, and so on. Due to these concerns, a new technology
    emerged for the building of Internet-based apps called **decentralized applications**
    (**DApps**). In this chapter, we will learn about decentralized apps.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A DApp is a kind of Internet application whose backend runs on a decentralized
    peer-to-peer network and its source code is open source. No single node in the
    network has complete control over the DApp.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the functionality of the DApp, different data structures are used
    to store application data. For example, the Bitcoin DApp uses the blockchain data
    structure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These peers can be any computer connected to the Internet; therefore, it becomes
    a big challenge to detect and prevent peers from making invalid changes to the
    application data and sharing wrong information with others. So we need some sort
    of consensus between the peers regarding whether the data published by a peer
    is right or wrong. There is no central server in a DApp to coordinate the peers
    and decide what is right and wrong; therefore, it becomes really difficult to
    solve this challenge. There are certain protocols (specifically called consensus
    protocols) to tackle this challenge. Consensus protocols are designed specifically
    for the type of data structure the DApp uses. For example, Bitcoin uses the proof-of-work
    protocol to achieve consensus.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every DApp needs a client for the user to use the DApp. To use a DApp, we first
    need a node in the network by running our own node server of the DApp and then
    connecting the client to the node server. Nodes of a DApp provide an API only
    and let the developer community develop various clients using the API. Some DApp
    developers officially provide a client. Clients of DApps should be open source
    and should be downloaded for use; otherwise, the whole idea of decentralization
    will fail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this architecture of a client is cumbersome to set up, especially if the
    user is a non-developer; therefore, clients are usually hosted and/or nodes are
    hosted as a service to make the process of using a DApp easier.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Distributed applications are those applications that are spread across multiple
    servers instead of just one. This is necessary when application data and traffic
    becomes huge and application downtime is not affordable. In distributed applications,
    data is replicated among various servers to achieve high availability of data.
    Centralized applications may or may not be distributed, but decentralized applications
    are always distributed. For example, Google, Facebook, Slack, Dropbox, and so
    on are distributed, whereas a simple portfolio site or a personal blog are not
    usually distributed until traffic is very high.

    whom the government can pressurize to remove some content. Governments cannot
    even block the app's domain or IP address as DApps are not accessed via a particular
    IP address or domain. Obviously the government can track individual nodes in the
    network by their IP address and shut them down, but if the network is huge, then
    it becomes next to impossible to shut down the app, especially if the nodes are
    distributed among various different countries.

    DApps shouldn't depend on centralized application APIs, but DApps can be dependent
    on other DApps. As there isn't a large ecosystem of DApps yet, it is difficult
    to build a DApp. Although DApps can be dependent on other DApps theoretically,
    it is very difficult to tightly couple DApps practically.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the major advantages of DApps is that it generally guarantees user anonymity.
    But many applications require the process of verifying user identity to use the
    app. As there is no central authority in a DApp, it become a challenge to verify
    the user identity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In centralized applications, humans verify user identity by requesting the user
    to submit certain scanned documents, OTP verification, and so on. This process
    is called **know your customer** (**KYC**). But as there is no human to verify
    user identity in DApps, the DApp has to verify the user identity itself. Obviously
    DApps cannot understand and verify scanned documents, nor can they send SMSes;
    therefore, we need to feed them with digital identities that they can understand
    and verify. The major problem is that hardly any DApps have digital identities
    and only a few people know how to get a digital identity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are various forms of digital identities. Currently, the most recommended
    and popular form is a digital certificate. A digital certificate (also called
    a public key certificate or identity certificate) is an electronic document used
    to prove ownership of a public key. Basically, a user owns a private key, public
    key, and digital certificate. The private key is secret and the user shouldn't
    share it with anyone. The public key can be shared with anyone. The digital certificate
    holds the public key and information about who owns the public key. Obviously,
    it's not difficult to produce this kind of certificate; therefore, a digital certificate
    is always issued by an authorized entity that you can trust. The digital certificate
    has an encrypted field that's encrypted by the private key of the certificate
    authority. To verify the authenticity of the certificate, we just need to decrypt
    the field using the public key of the certificate authority, and if it decrypts
    successfully, then we know that the certificate is valid.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if users successfully get digital identities and they are verified by the
    DApp, there is a still a major issue; that is, there are various digital certificate
    issuing authorities, and to verify a digital certificate, we need the public key
    of the issuing authority. It is really difficult to include the public keys of
    all the authorities and update/add new ones. Due to this issue, the procedure
    of digital identity verification is usually included on the client side so that
    it can be easily updated. Just moving this verification procedure to the client
    side doesn't completely solve this issue because there are lots of authorities
    issuing digital certificates and keeping track of all of them, and adding them
    to the client side, is cumbersome.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often, while we do trading in real life, we usually verify the identity of the
    other person ourselves or we bring in an authority to verify the identity. This
    idea can be applied to DApps as well. Users can verify each other's identity manually
    before performing trade with each other. This idea works for specific kinds of
    DApps, that is, for DApps in which people trade with each other. For example,
    if a DApp is a decentralized social network, then obviously a profile cannot be
    verified by this means. But if the DApp is for people to buy/sell something, then
    before making a payment, the buyer and seller can both verify each other's identity.
    Although this idea may seem fine while doing trading, when you think practically,
    it becomes very difficult because you may not want to do identity verification
    every time you trade and everyone not knows how to do identity verification. For
    example, if the DApp is a cab-booking app, then you will obviously not want to
    perform identity verification before booking a cab every time. But if you trade
    sometimes and you know how to verify identity, then it's fine to follow this procedure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to these issues, the only option we are currently left with is verifying
    user identity manually by an authorized person of the company that provides the
    client. For example, to create a Bitcoin account, we don't need an identification,
    but while withdrawing Bitcoin to flat currency, the exchanges ask for proof of
    identification. Clients can omit the unverified users and not let them use the
    client. And they can keep the client open for users whose identity has been verified
    by them. This solution also ends up with minor issues; that is, if you switch
    the client, you will not find the same set of users to interact with because different
    clients have different sets of verified users. Due to this, all users may decide
    to use a particular client only, thus creating a monopoly among clients. But this
    isn't a major issue because if the client fails to properly verify users, then
    users can easily move to another client without losing their critical data, as
    they are stored as decentralized.

- en: The idea of verifying user identity in applications is to make it difficult
    for users to escape after performing some sort of fraudulent activity, preventing
    users with a fraud/criminal background from using the application, and providing
    the means for other users in the network to believe a user to be whom the user
    is claiming to be. It doesn't matter what procedure is used to verify user identity;
    they are always ways for users to represent themselves to be someone else. It
    doesn't matter whether we use digital identities or scanned documents for verification
    because both can be stolen and reused. What's important is just to make it difficult
    for users to represent themselves to be someone else and also collect enough data
    to track a user and prove that the user has done a fraudulent activity.

- en: Many applications need user accounts' functionality. Data associated with an
    account should be modifiable by the account owner only. DApps simply cannot have
    the same username- and password-based account functionality as do centralized
    applications because passwords cannot prove that the data change for an account
    has been requested by the owner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are quite a few ways to implement user accounts in DApps. But the most
    popular way is using a public-private key pair to represent an account. The hash
    of the public key is the unique identifier of the account. To make a change to
    the account's data, the user needs to sign the change using his/her private key.
    We need to assume that users will store their private keys safely. If users lose
    their private keys, then they lose access to their account forever.

    But in some cases, there is no other option. For example, if a DApp wants to read
    a football score, then where will it get the data from? Although a DApp can depend
    on another DApp, why will FIFA create a DApp? FIFA will not create a DApp just
    because other DApps want the data. This is because a DApp to provide scores is
    of no benefit as it will ultimately be controlled by FIFA completely.

- en: So in some cases, a DApp needs to fetch data from a centralized application.
    But the major problem is how the DApp knows that the data fetched from a domain
    is not tampered by a middle service/man and is the actual response. Well, there
    are various ways to resolve this depending on the DApp architecture. For example,
    in Ethereum, for the smart contracts to access centralized APIs, they can use
    the Oraclize service as a middleman as smart contracts cannot make direct HTTP
    requests. Oraclize provides a TLSNotary proof for the data it fetches for the
    smart contract from centralized services.

    needs to make a profit in order to keep it running. DApps don't have an owner,
    but still, like any other centralized app, the nodes of a DApp need hardware and
    network resources to keep it running. So the nodes of a DApp need something useful
    in return to keep the DApp running. That's where internal currency comes into
    play. Most DApps have a built-in internal currency, or we can say that most successful
    DApps have a built-in internal currency.

    on the consensus protocol, only certain kinds of nodes earn currency. We can also

- en: Let's look at an overview of how IPFS works. When we store a file in IPFS, it's
    split into chunks < 256 KB and hashes of each of these chunks are generated. Nodes
    in the network hold the IPFS files they need and their hashes in a hash table.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are four types of IPFS files: blob, list, tree, and commit. A blob represents
    a chunk of an actual file that''s stored in IPFS. A list represents a complete
    file as it holds the list of blobs and other lists. As lists can hold other lists,
    it helps in data compression over the network. A tree represents a directory as
    it holds a list of blobs, lists, other trees, and commits. And a commit file represents
    a snapshot in the version history of any other file. As lists, trees, and commits
    have links to other IPFS files, they form a Merkle DAG.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when we want to download a file from the network, we just need the hash of
    the IPFS list file. Or if we want to download a directory, then we just need the
    hash of the IPFS tree file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As every file is identified by a hash, the names are not easy to remember. If
    we update a file, then we need to share a new hash with everyone that wants to
    download that file. To tackle this issue, IPFS uses the IPNS feature, which allows
    IPFS files to be pointed using self-certified names or human-friendly names.

    are controlled by large companies and governments. Therefore, domain names are
    prone to censorship. Governments and companies usually block domain names if the
    website is doing something illegal or making loss for them or due to some other
    reason.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to this, there was a need for a decentralized domain name database. As Namecoin
    stores key-value data just like DNS servers, Namecoin can be used to implement
    a decentralized DNS, and this is what it has already been used for. The d and
    ds namespaces contain keys ending with `.bit`, representing `.bit` domain names.
    Technically, a namespace doesn't have any naming convention for the keys but all
    the nodes and clients of Namecoin agree to this naming convention. If we try to
    store invalid keys in `d` and `ds` namespaces, then clients will filter invalid
    keys.

    decentralized.
  prefs: []

    store the certificate hash in Namecoin. When a client that supports TLS for `.bit`
    domains tries to access a secured `.bit` domain, it will match the hash of the
    certificate returned by the server with the hash stored in Namecoin, and if they
    match, then they proceed with further communication with the server.

    INR balance on ripple, X will visit the XX office or website and deposit 30,000
    INR and then XX will broadcast a transaction saying I owe X 30,000 INR. Now assume
    that there is a gateway YY in the USA, which allows only USD transactions and
    Y trusts YY gateway. Now, say, gateways XX and YY don't trust each other. As X
    and Y don't trust a common gateway, XX and YY don't trust each other, and finally,
    XX and YY don't support the same currency. Therefore, for X to send money to Y,
    he needs to find intermediary gateways to form a trust chain. Assume there is
    another gateway, ZZ, that is trusted by both XX and YY and it supports USD and
    INR. So now X can send a transaction by transferring 50,000 INR from XX to ZZ
    and it gets converted to USD by ZZ and then ZZ sends the money to YY, asking YY
    to give the money to Y. Now instead of X owing Y $500, YY owes $500 to Y, ZZ owes
    $500 to YY, and XX owes 30,000 INR to ZZ. But it's all fine because they trust
    each other, whereas earlier, X and Y didn't trust each other. But XX, YY, and

    immutable history. Consensus is required to make sure that all nodes have the
    same ledger at a given point of time. In ripple, there is a third kind of node
    called validators, which are part of the consensus protocol. Validators are responsible
    for validating transactions. Anyone can become a validator. But other nodes keep
    a list of validators that can be actually trusted. This list is known as UNL (unique
    node list). A validator also has a UNL; that is, the validators it trusts as validators
    also want to reach a consensus. Currently, ripple decides the list of validators
    that can be trusted, but if the network thinks that validators selected by ripple
    are not trustworthy, then they can modify the list in their node software.

- en: You can form a ledger by taking the previous ledger and applying all the transactions
    that have happened since then. So to agree on the current ledger, nodes must agree
    on the previous ledger and the set of transactions that have happened since then.
    After a new ledger is created, a node (both regular nodes and validators) starts
    a timer (of a few seconds, approximately 5 seconds) and collects the new transactions
    that arrived during the creation of the previous ledger. When the timer expires,
    it takes those transactions that are valid according to at least 80% of the UNLs
    and forms the next ledger. Validators broadcast a proposal (a set of transactions
    they think are valid to form the next ledger) to the network. Validators can broadcast
    proposals for the same ledger multiple times with a different set of transactions
    if they decide to change the list of valid transactions depending on proposals
    from their UNLs and other factors. So you only need to wait 5-10 seconds for your
    transaction to be confirmed by the network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some people wonder whether this can lead to many different versions of the ledger
    since each node may have a different UNL. As long as there is a minimal degree
    of inter-connectivity between UNLs, a consensus will rapidly be reached. This
    is primarily because every honest node's primary goal is to achieve a consensus.
