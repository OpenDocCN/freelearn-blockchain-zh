    Peer-to-peer lending is a popular niche, but informational asymmetries impede
    its implementation on a large scale. P2P lending relies on a solid idea. If people
    deposit their funds in banks and then banks use their customers' money to lend
    it to other people, doesn't it make more sense for depositors to lend their money
    directly to borrowers and earn a higher rate of return on their money? Banks seem
    to be the redundant middleman in this equation, don't they? Their main added value

    sure there are adequate rules in place that balance the interests of all parties
    involved. On one hand, they need to protect retail investors (private individuals)
    who are considered potentially vulnerable due to lack of experience and expertise
    in evaluating market risk and making investment decisions. On the other hand,
    regulators should also help maintain efficient and orderly capital markets that
    allow companies to raise enough capital to fund their operations, boost innovation,
    and ultimately stimulate the economy. This makes the job of financial regulators
    a really important and demanding one. They need to constantly keep up with new
    types of financial engineering and sometimes exotic structures and instruments
    like various financial derivative products and their risk profiles. They need
    to constantly keep a watchful eye on publicly traded corporations and institutional
    investors for potential mischief by their management, which can involve false
    accounting, insider or otherwise rogue trading, Ponzi or pyramid schemes, or other
    regulatory violations. The list of examples in history is really long and the
    creativity of people when money is on the line is unlimited. We already mentioned
    earlier some huge multi-billion-dollar scandals involving Enron, WorldCom, Bernie
    Madoff, and pretty much all major banks. Moreover, regulators need to be especially

    mix of currency, commodity, and equity features they appear to have, is a totally
    different and complex question. On one side, everybody has heard of cryptocurrencies
    and uses this term to refer to the entire cryptoasset space. But they don't account
    for all currencies. Actually, commodities may be closer in their nature to the
    cryptoassets, out of all the established asset classes. This is because their
    market value is determined by supply and demand for the utility or use case they
    enable. And this should be the case with many cryptoassets too. For example, the
    Ethereum tokens give access to the computational power of the Ethereum network
    and to data storage on the secure, immutable Ethereum blockchain. This looks like
    a real use case, similar to many commodities in our modern economy. Think about
    oil, electricity, and cargo or freight; these are all tradable commodities with
    substantial utility in the modern economy. Perhaps, Ethereum and some of its blockchain
    peers will follow suit. And what about Bitcoin? It is gaining the widely recognized
    status of digital gold. Its utility, as a store of value, is similar to a certain
    extent to that of gold. The **Chicago Mercantile Exchange** (or **CME**), one
    of the largest regulated financial and commodity derivative exchanges in the world,

- en: Most large car producers experiment with some sort of car sharing, ride sharing,
    or hailing schemes. For example, a few years ago, Daimler introduced Car2Go, a
    short-term car rental service, which allows people to hop in a car and use it
    for transportation from point A to point B. The flexibility to leave a transportation
    vehicle on the street feels like a change of paradigm for many people living in
    big cities. It is hard, and frankly next to impossible, to find a parking space
    during peak hours in places such as New York, London, Hong Kong, Paris, Tokyo,
    Shanghai, and many others. It is much more convenient economically to use a car
    for a limited amount of time and then pass it on to the next user who needs it.
    And it is not only Daimler experimenting with such smart vehicle sharing schemes.
    Another example is the collaboration between Fiat and the oil producer Eni in
    Italy. Their joint venture is called **Enjoy** and it offers a similar service.
    Most automakers need to adapt to this new business model, or they risk losing
    market share. On one hand, they see car sharing as a threat because it means that
    not every individual needs to buy and maintain a personal vehicle. On the other
    hand though, it can be seen also as an opportunity because car sharing can allow
    these companies to build subscription-based businesses. This could make up for
    the lost revenue in traditional segments and could even create more value.

    agencies such as the CIA use it. So, it would be hard for projects such as Filecoin,
    Storj, Sia, MadeSafe, and the rest to gain traction with most of the established
    AWS user base, at least initially. Such decentralized storage solutions are more
    likely to be used first by other emerging decentralized applications in the blockchain
    economy. Nevertheless, the idea to distribute file storage across a network of
    consumer devices, utilize their spare capacity, and reward them for that with
    cryptographic tokens is very interesting and innovative. This is a continuation
    of the shared economy and spare capacity utilization trend we have been observing
    recently and can be a great opportunity for people looking to rent file storage
    space, and for those who have excess storage capacity. After all, AirBnB does
    a similar thing with real estate.

  zh: AWS以非常有竞争力的价格提供安全存储，甚至美国政府机构如中情局都在使用它。因此，对于像Filecoin、Storj、Sia、MadeSafe等项目来说，至少在最初阶段，要吸引大多数已经在使用AWS的用户群体是很困难的。这样的分散式存储解决方案更有可能首先被区块链经济中的其他新兴分散式应用程序使用。尽管如此，通过将文件存储分散到一个消费者设备网络中，利用它们的闲置容量，并用加密令牌奖励它们的想法非常有趣和创新。这是我们最近观察到的共享经济和闲置容量利用趋势的延续，也是为寻求租用文件存储空间的人和拥有多余存储容量的人提供了一个巨大的机会。毕竟，AirBnB对房地产做了类似的事情。

- en: The release of the first iPod, in 2001, can be marked as the beginning of Apple's
    renaissance. The company went on to create some of the most impactful and beloved
    consumer electronics products the technology world has ever seen. The iPod, the
    iPhone, the iPad, the iMac, and iTunes sky rocketed the company's value and turned
    it into the biggest company in the world by market capitalization.

- en: One of the fundamental beliefs of Apple's legendary co-founder Steve Jobs was
    that computer systems (and later mobile devices) should operate within a centralized
    ecosystem. According to him, consumers choose products that put together the best
    combination of hardware and software, and customers shouldn't be the ones deciding
    what type of software runs on their devices. This is what they pay consumer electronics
    producers to do for them. This insight that consumers value convenience the most
    makes a lot of sense and has been a key driving force behind Apple's success.
    Jobs also believed that iPhones, iPods, and iPads are predominantly software-driven
    and that is what made them so unique, apart from their beautiful design.

  zh: 苹果传奇联合创始人史蒂夫·乔布斯的基本信念之一是，计算机系统（后来是移动设备）应该在一个中心化的生态系统内运行。按照他的观点，消费者选择将硬件和软件最佳组合在一起的产品，而消费者不该成为决定他们设备上运行的软件类型的人。这是他们付费给消费电子生产商为他们所做的事情。消费者最看重便利性的这个观点非常有道理，也一直是苹果成功的关键驱动力。乔布斯还认为，iPhone、iPod和iPad主要是由软件驱动的，这也是使它们如此独特的地方，除了它们美丽的设计。

- en: If people start feeling that decentralizing software applications and the economy
    overall is the preferred way forward, and Apple continues to exercise the same
    centralized authoritarian practices, this can be a potentially pivotal moment.
    Currently, Apple enjoys an incredibly loyal customer base among several generations
    of consumers. Apple's audience is so captive that it resembles the fan base of
    a sports club. Apple converts never change sides. But this following must be nurtured
    continuously with exciting new products and features in order to maintain its
    momentum across new generations of consumers. Shifting consumer tastes could weaken
    Apple's competitive edge. For the first time since the introduction of the first
    iPod many years ago, Apple cannot boast capturing consumer mindshare and leading
    the way with its exciting new technology. Instead, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the
    rest of the blockchain crypto-economy have been doing this recently. In a scenario
    in which decentralization becomes as trendy as we expect, Apple will have to loosen
    some of its grip on its walled garden and allow its devices to operate with decentralized
    applications, or it would risk losing market share to a competitor that serves
    the needs of the market better.

  zh: 如果人们开始感觉到分散化的软件应用和整体经济是未来的首选方式，而苹果继续实施同样的中央集权做法，这可能是一个潜在的关键时刻。目前，苹果在几代消费者中拥有非常忠诚的客户群。苹果的受众如同体育俱乐部的球迷群一样忠诚。苹果的拥趸永远不会改变立场。但是，为了在新一代消费者中保持势头，必须不断培育这一追随者，并推出令人兴奋的新产品和功能。消费者口味的转变可能会削弱苹果的竞争优势。自多年前首次推出第一款iPod以来，苹果首次无法自豪地宣称夺得消费者的心智，并且以其令人兴奋的新技术引领潮流。相反，最近比特币、以太坊和其他区块链加密经济的表现卓越。在我们预期的分散化变得像我们所期望的那样流行的情况下，苹果将不得不放松对其封闭花园的控制，并允许其设备与分散式应用程序一起运行，否则它将面临市场份额被服务市场需求更好的竞争对手夺走的风险。

    a patent it filed to create and store timestamps and protect secure elements such
    as SIM or micro SD cards storing confidential information on its devices. Essentially,
    blockchain could allow Apple to boost the security of its devices and applications
    even more. Right now, Apple's devices have best-in-class encryption. Remember
    how the CIA battled with the company over the encryption of an iPhone? Well, by
