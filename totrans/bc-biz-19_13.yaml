    third-party interference. Whatever digital money you have on the blockchain, it
    will be there, and nobody can take it away, provided you store your private keys
    properly. Therefore, banks aren't the only option for storing your funds anymore.
    The most clear evidence that people consider cryptoassets as a viable alternative
    comes from countries suffering hyperinflation, like the recent examples with Zimbabwe

    could provide superior options for such transactions. Blockchain-based money transfers
    take less time, and do not cost nearly as much as traditional bank transfers.
    Currently (at this early stage of the technology), Bitcoin takes a few minutes
    to a few hours to process a payment, while international bank transfers usually
    take at least three working days to settle. Other blockchains, such as Ethereum,
    Litecoin, Ripple, and Stellar, enable even faster and cheaper transactions, which
    can provide huge savings compared to the amount of time and fees it takes banks
    to do the same. And some improvements to these protocols, such as the lightning
    network, can provide even more efficiency. So, national and especially international
    money transfers are a service that will likely be disrupted.

    Peer-to-peer lending is a popular niche, but informational asymmetries impede
    its implementation on a large scale. P2P lending relies on a solid idea. If people
    deposit their funds in banks and then banks use their customers' money to lend
    it to other people, doesn't it make more sense for depositors to lend their money
    directly to borrowers and earn a higher rate of return on their money? Banks seem
    to be the redundant middleman in this equation, don't they? Their main added value
    comes from the fact that they arguably have expertise in sorting out good from
    bad borrowers, and also specialize in dealing with bad debtors once they stop

    the type of borrower they are about to lend money to. Moreover, this information
    would be immutable and easily accessible. This would create a competitive market
    where lending services are easily accessible to people because they are less expensive
    and faster. Banks are burdened by huge administrative costs, which inflate the
    final interest rates they charge borrowers. In a P2P lending market facilitated

    is implemented in the context of post-trade settlement. An improved process trusted
    by both counterparties will reduce settlement times because both sides share and

    prearranged conditions are preserved. Moreover, there will be fewer mechanical
    errors deriving from system failure. All market participants could share the same
    automated settlement system on the blockchain. Of course, all of this will lead
    to audit and reconciliation efficiencies too. Individual parties involved in each
    trade will not have to do unnecessary replication of records and perform audits
    to ensure overall consistency. Ultimately, banks will be able to have leaner and

    sure there are adequate rules in place that balance the interests of all parties
    involved. On one hand, they need to protect retail investors (private individuals)
    who are considered potentially vulnerable due to lack of experience and expertise
    in evaluating market risk and making investment decisions. On the other hand,
    regulators should also help maintain efficient and orderly capital markets that
    allow companies to raise enough capital to fund their operations, boost innovation,
    and ultimately stimulate the economy. This makes the job of financial regulators
    a really important and demanding one. They need to constantly keep up with new
    types of financial engineering and sometimes exotic structures and instruments
    like various financial derivative products and their risk profiles. They need
    to constantly keep a watchful eye on publicly traded corporations and institutional
    investors for potential mischief by their management, which can involve false
    accounting, insider or otherwise rogue trading, Ponzi or pyramid schemes, or other
    regulatory violations. The list of examples in history is really long and the
    creativity of people when money is on the line is unlimited. We already mentioned
    earlier some huge multi-billion-dollar scandals involving Enron, WorldCom, Bernie
    Madoff, and pretty much all major banks. Moreover, regulators need to be especially
    careful with large financial enterprises that can represent systemic risk, meaning
    that if they get in trouble this could endanger the entire financial and economic
    system.

    mix of currency, commodity, and equity features they appear to have, is a totally
    different and complex question. On one side, everybody has heard of cryptocurrencies
    and uses this term to refer to the entire cryptoasset space. But they don't account
    for all currencies. Actually, commodities may be closer in their nature to the
    cryptoassets, out of all the established asset classes. This is because their
    market value is determined by supply and demand for the utility or use case they
    enable. And this should be the case with many cryptoassets too. For example, the
    Ethereum tokens give access to the computational power of the Ethereum network
    and to data storage on the secure, immutable Ethereum blockchain. This looks like
    a real use case, similar to many commodities in our modern economy. Think about
    oil, electricity, and cargo or freight; these are all tradable commodities with
    substantial utility in the modern economy. Perhaps, Ethereum and some of its blockchain
    peers will follow suit. And what about Bitcoin? It is gaining the widely recognized
    status of digital gold. Its utility, as a store of value, is similar to a certain
    extent to that of gold. The **Chicago Mercantile Exchange** (or **CME**), one
    of the largest regulated financial and commodity derivative exchanges in the world,
    seems to share this view, evidenced by its listing of Bitcoin futures contracts
    in December 2017.

    or hailing schemes. For example, a few years ago, Daimler introduced Car2Go, a
    short-term car rental service, which allows people to hop in a car and use it
    for transportation from point A to point B. The flexibility to leave a transportation
    vehicle on the street feels like a change of paradigm for many people living in
    big cities. It is hard, and frankly next to impossible, to find a parking space
    during peak hours in places such as New York, London, Hong Kong, Paris, Tokyo,
    Shanghai, and many others. It is much more convenient economically to use a car
    for a limited amount of time and then pass it on to the next user who needs it.
    And it is not only Daimler experimenting with such smart vehicle sharing schemes.
    Another example is the collaboration between Fiat and the oil producer Eni in
    Italy. Their joint venture is called **Enjoy** and it offers a similar service.
    Most automakers need to adapt to this new business model, or they risk losing
    market share. On one hand, they see car sharing as a threat because it means that
    not every individual needs to buy and maintain a personal vehicle. On the other
    hand though, it can be seen also as an opportunity because car sharing can allow
    these companies to build subscription-based businesses. This could make up for
    the lost revenue in traditional segments and could even create more value.

    services in the global economy. Blockchain-based solutions can help car sharing
    service providers verify drivers' identities, driving histories, and previous
    car-sharing usage. This could help mitigate certain risks with greater precision
    based on the risk profiles of individual drivers. Smart contracts can enable automatic
    payments related to toll road fees, and insurance contracts that could be adjusted
    according to the driver's profile and the distance he or she travels. They can
    also be used for automatic payments for cleaning, refueling, and other services
    during the journey. Such automation would boost efficiency and enhance user experience.

- en: Why use blockchain-based smart contracts and not simply upload data to a central
    server managed by a corporation? Well, think of it this way. People are becoming
    more wary about sharing their personal information with an external party, and
    allowing it to manage everything for them, to keep their data safe, maintain professional
    business practices, and charge fair prices. And rightfully so. Such centralization
    creates single points of failure. We have seen countless cases of personal data
    breaches, misuse, unethical practices such as selling personal data to any third
    party that is willing to pay, outright fraud, data theft, and abuse of dominant
    market position.
  prefs: []

    each managing a certain stage of the process. One firm can be in charge of insurance,
    another one of cleaning, a third company can be responsible for toll collection,
    and so on. And of course, the company managing the car sharing service will be
    in the mix too, but it wouldn't dominate the landscape. A blockchain solution
    allows for decentralization of the value chain, distributing data and market power
    across multiple parties and preventing any single entity from becoming a central
    point of failure, bottleneck, or a rent-seeker that could abuse its market position.

    calculate all fees and value exchanges involved in the service based on distance,

    There are many blockchain projects building decentralized marketplaces, although
    most of them are not exactly for the consumer products you'll find on Amazon.
    These new challengers mostly focus on virtual goods such as computer game items,
    spare computer capacity, electricity, and so on. One notable new entrant in the
    e-commerce space and a direct competitor to Amazon.com is OpenBazaar. It was launched
    in 2016, backed by venture capital investors including Andreessen Horowitz and
    Union Square Ventures, and offers a fully decentralized peer-to-peer e-commerce
    marketplace where users can pay with multiple cryptocurrencies. It is less feature-rich
    than Amazon and other established market leaders, but it has zero platform fees
    and it doesn't control its users' personal data.

    Amazon has the critical mass and network traffic of many buyers and sellers. This
    is similar to a shopping mall in a prime central city area with a high density
    of people around. It has also the advantage of consumer habit and many user features
    on its side. This is a great market position to be in for Amazon, and hence it's
    among the highest valued companies in the world by equity investors.

    These costs are both monetary and in terms of personal data. And as we know, data
    has become one of the most valuable commodities in the internet age. Amazon fully
    controls the platform and all information that passes through it. It can also
    restrict access to any third parties at will.

    including lower or no fees, control of their data, and unobstructed access to
    the platform. Let's see how far such platforms can go and whether they will be
    able to compete meaningfully with Amazon and the other centralized services we
    use today.

    diversify their distribution channels to such platforms in order to mitigate business
    risks and lower costs. On the other hand, consumer traffic may be trickier to
    attract, as many consumers tend to put convenience first and don't care that much
    about their privacy. At least for now… But this trend is likely to start changing
    with more public awareness and interest going into that direction, especially
    in the light of the recent scandals with Facebook, Experian, and other companies
    with widely reported data breaches.

    lower prices certainly can help attract consumers to new platforms. Moreover,
    tokens have the potential upside of value appreciation that goes along with the
    growth of the marketplace and network as a whole. In this way, a decentralized
    marketplace can share the value of its network effects with its users. This is
    the power of blockchain to align incentives across all participants in a network.

    AWS user base, at least initially. Such decentralized storage solutions are more
    likely to be used first by other emerging decentralized applications in the blockchain
    economy. Nevertheless, the idea to distribute file storage across a network of
    consumer devices, utilize their spare capacity, and reward them for that with
    cryptographic tokens is very interesting and innovative. This is a continuation
    of the shared economy and spare capacity utilization trend we have been observing
    recently and can be a great opportunity for people looking to rent file storage
    space, and for those who have excess storage capacity. After all, AirBnB does

    that computer systems (and later mobile devices) should operate within a centralized
    ecosystem. According to him, consumers choose products that put together the best
    combination of hardware and software, and customers shouldn't be the ones deciding
    what type of software runs on their devices. This is what they pay consumer electronics
    producers to do for them. This insight that consumers value convenience the most
    makes a lot of sense and has been a key driving force behind Apple's success.
    Jobs also believed that iPhones, iPods, and iPads are predominantly software-driven
    and that is what made them so unique, apart from their beautiful design.

    overall is the preferred way forward, and Apple continues to exercise the same
    centralized authoritarian practices, this can be a potentially pivotal moment.
    Currently, Apple enjoys an incredibly loyal customer base among several generations
    of consumers. Apple's audience is so captive that it resembles the fan base of
    a sports club. Apple converts never change sides. But this following must be nurtured
    continuously with exciting new products and features in order to maintain its
    momentum across new generations of consumers. Shifting consumer tastes could weaken
    Apple's competitive edge. For the first time since the introduction of the first
    iPod many years ago, Apple cannot boast capturing consumer mindshare and leading
    the way with its exciting new technology. Instead, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the
    rest of the blockchain crypto-economy have been doing this recently. In a scenario
    in which decentralization becomes as trendy as we expect, Apple will have to loosen
    some of its grip on its walled garden and allow its devices to operate with decentralized
    applications, or it would risk losing market share to a competitor that serves
    the needs of the market better.
