  zh: 与牛津大学量子计算研究员山姆·麦卡德尔的采访
- en: In several previous chapters of this book, I have touched upon the barriers
    for quantum computing to go mainstream. One of the major barriers with quantum
    computing is the challenges with error correction. In a classical computer, bits
    have two states, "0" and "1." Therefore, error correction is a lot easier. In
    a quantum computer, qubits can exist in superpositions at any point in time during
    the calculation. As a result, it is harder to observe and correct their values
    without disrupting the calculation.

  zh: 在本书的几个前章中，我已经触及了量子计算走向主流的障碍。量子计算的一个主要障碍是错误校正的挑战。在经典计算机中，比特有两种状态，“0”和“1”。因此，错误校正要容易得多。在量子计算机中，量子比特在计算过程中的任何时间点都可以处于叠加状态。因此，要在不中断计算的情况下观察和校正它们的值更加困难。
- en: Error correction within quantum computing is a fascinating space and there are
    several techniques being explored. Hence, I wanted to dedicate one interview,
    and thus a chapter, to this topic. I met Sam McArdle at a quantum computing event
    at the University of Bristol. He made a presentation at the event on his research
    at the University of Oxford. The research focused on quantum error correction.

  zh: 量子计算中的错误修正是一个迷人的领域，有几种技术正在被探索。因此，我想专门进行一次采访，因此一个章节，来讨论这个主题。我在布里斯托大学的一个量子计算活动上遇到了山姆·麦卡德尔。他在活动上做了一个关于他在牛津大学的研究的演讲。该研究集中在量子错误校正上。
- en: Sam's presentation at the event was fascinating, mainly because he simplified
    the narrative. He still got technical where he had to during the presentation,
    but it was clear that the audience were engaged in his speech and followed up
    with several interesting questions. That was in line with my way of looking at
    this technology. Despite the complexities within the Math and Physics of quantum
    computing, there is always room to keep it all simple from a use case perspective.

- en: It was that classical computers take a concept in Physics, use Math to translate
    it to computer-understandable code, and then replicate Physics based on the code.
    It takes three hops before it gets Physics to look like Physics on a classical
    computer. Quantum computers just naturally model Physics without as much translation.
    Therefore, there is less loss of information while simulating nature using quantum
    computers. It's interesting because we are here to discuss loss of information
    within quantum computers. Let's touch upon error correction in quantum computers
    and why that is different from error correction in a classical computing context.

  zh: 经典计算机将物理概念转化为计算机可理解的代码，并基于该代码复制物理过程。在将物理变成经典计算机上的物理之前，需要经历三个阶段。量子计算机则更自然地模拟物理过程，而不需要太多的转化。因此，在使用量子计算机模拟自然过程时，信息损失较少。这很有趣，因为我们在这里讨论量子计算机内的信息损失。让我们谈谈量子计算机中的错误校正以及与经典计算环境中的错误校正有何不同。
- en: '**Sam**: Let''s first touch upon errors in the context of classical and quantum
    computers. In a classical machine, you have to consider "bit-flip" errors; the
    probabilistic flipping of a bit from zero to one. These are also present in a
    quantum computer. However, quantum computers also suffer from another type of
    error, called phase-flip errors, which also need to be corrected.'

- en: These errors can be addressed using error correction techniques. In classical
    error correction code, we can take many copies of our bits and perform majority
    voting schemes. Therefore, you don't need much in the way of error correcting
    properties in classical computers, with the exception of hard drives and other
    things that are going to store memory for a long time.

  zh: 这些错误可以通过纠错技术来解决。在经典纠错码中，我们可以复制我们的位并执行多数投票方案。因此，在经典计算机中，除了硬盘和其他需要长时间存储内存的设备外，你不需要太多的纠错性能。
- en: These have some redundancy built in, which stops the degradation of information
    over time as well, but their fault level is low. It's approximately one part in
    10^(15). In today's classical computers, we focus more on handling errors that
    occur programmatically. Therefore, in a classical computer, we don't really worry
    about error correction as a limitation.
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这些也内置了一些冗余，这样可以阻止信息随时间的流逝而逐渐降解，但它们的故障级别很低。大约是10^(15)中的一部分。在今天的经典计算机中，我们更关注处理在编程过程中发生的错误。因此，在经典计算机中，我们并不真正担心纠错作为一种限制。
- en: In contrast, a quantum computer is much more sensitive to the environment. Therefore,
    error correction is a lot more delicate. If it was approximately one part of 10^(15)
    in a classical hard drive, it is closer to one part in 10² or 10³ in the quantum
    computers we have now.
  id: totrans-12

  zh: 相比之下，量子计算机对环境的敏感性要高得多。因此，纠错要更加谨慎。如果在经典硬盘中大约是10^(15)的一个部分，那么在我们现在拥有的量子计算机中，它更接近于10²或10³的一个部分。
- en: If you're going to run a calculation for a long time, you need to correct against
    imperfections arising from interaction with the environment. There are ways of
    doing this using quantum error code. It is another level of difficulty in the
    sense that, when we use classical error correcting code, you can just directly
    interrogate the information in your device. The most common one that people talk
    about is repetition code.

  zh: 如果你要长时间运行计算，你需要纠正由于与环境的相互作用而产生的缺陷。有一些方法可以使用量子纠错码来实现这一点。从难度的角度来看，当我们使用经典的纠错码时，你可以直接审查你设备中的信息。人们谈论的最常见的一个是重复码。
- en: If you want to store a single bit that is "0" or "1", you can just copy it three
    times. If there is an error, it is very unlikely that there are going to be two
    bits affected by it. One error is the most likely thing that's going to occur,
    in which case when you look at your three copy bits, two of them are still the
    same and one of them might have changed. You can majority vote. You can see what
    errors have occurred and fix them. It's different in a quantum computer.

  zh: 如果你想要存储一个单个的位，它可以是"0"或者"1"，你可以简单地将它复制三次。如果发生错误，很不可能有两个位受到影响。一个错误是最有可能发生的事情，这种情况下当你查看你的三个复制位时，有两个仍然是相同的，而其中一个可能已经改变了。你可以采用多数投票的方式。你可以看出发生了什么错误并修正它们。在量子计算中则不同。
- en: 'Quantum computing takes advantage of two main quantum effects: superposition
    and entanglement. Superposition is the famous Schrodinger''s cat type effect –
    the ability of particles to be in two places at once, or quantum bits (qubits)
    to be in a joint state of zero or one at the same time – with the outcome only
    being revealed upon measurement. Entanglement can be loosely defined as a stronger-than-classical
    correlation between two particles, whereby it doesn''t really make sense to think
    of the two systems that are entangled as individual entities anymore. These two
    effects can be combined to give quantum computers their touted advantage over
    their classical counterparts.'

  zh: 量子计算利用了两种主要的量子效应：叠加和纠缠。叠加是著名的薛定谔的猫效应 - 粒子能够同时处于两个位置，或者量子位（qubit）可以同时处于零或一的联合状态
    - 只有在测量时才能揭示结果。纠缠可以宽泛地定义为两个粒子之间的比经典更强的相关性，因此不再有意义地将纠缠的两个系统视为单独的实体。这两种效应可以结合起来，使量子计算机比其经典对应物具有优势。
- en: However, quantum information is delicate, and these same effects can become
    rather damaging. In a quantum computer, error correction gets more difficult because
    you can't copy information across and you can't directly interrogate the quantum
    bits, because that would reveal in what state they are and interrupt your whole
    calculation. You have to be smarter about how to interrogate the system to try and
    learn what errors have occurred and find ways to correct those.
  id: totrans-16

  zh: 然而，量子信息是脆弱的，同样的效应会变得相当破坏性。在量子计算机中，由于你无法复制信息，也无法直接询问量子比特，因为那样会显示它们处于什么状态，并打断你的整个计算。你必须更聪明地去询问系统，尝试了解发生了什么错误，并找到纠正这些错误的方法。
- en: Our quantum computer has to sit in some kind of environment. The qubits in the
    computer interact with the environment. This manifests as a degradation of our
    quantum state, essentially forcing it to decay back to a classical state. Even
    though experimentalists try to shield their quantum computers from the environment
    (by keeping them at low temperatures, encased in vacuums, and/or shielded from
    magnetic fields), error rates are still much larger than one would find in a classical
    computer. Consequently, without any protection from errors, the quantum nature
    of the system will quickly decay away.

- en: We can provide a level of protection for our quantum systems using error correcting
    code. Loosely speaking, this represents the logical zero and one states of a qubit
    by encoding them in a highly entangled state that is spread over many qubits.
    We can make cleverly designed checks on our qubits that won't tell us exactly
    what the state is, but can at least tell us if certain errors have occurred, where
    they are, and how to correct them.

    is that you can realize it just with an array of qubits laid out in a grid with

- en: 'The other useful thing about the surface code is that it has got a very high
    *threshold of the code*. At this point you say: *This is the physical error rate
    in my system*. And the threshold says: *If I can get that error rate below a certain
    value, then I can make my code bigger. I can keep making the overall error rate

    applications of quantum computers within the next few years, this is currently
    unproven, and will require testing on real hardware systems as they become available.
    In order to run the provably fast algorithms developed for chemistry, machine
    learning, optimization, or cryptography, it is expected that quantum error correction
    will be necessary, as the circuits required are long.'

- en: As such, new developments in quantum error correction will hopefully reduce
    the resources required to implement useful algorithms. This includes both the

- en: Improvements in the former of these metrics will mean that useful quantum computers
    will become available for industrial applications sooner. Improvements in the

    counterparts for smaller problem sizes, again meaning that they may find use in

    in all our interviews. We have touched upon applications in financial services,
    healthcare, smart cities, and even politics. The interview with Sam had a different
    focus, and that was deliberate. I wanted to focus on one of the key barriers for
    quantum computing going mainstream – high error rates.

- en: We discussed why error correction in a quantum computer is harder than in a
    classical computer. The superposition property of qubits makes it harder for us
    to capture their states. When we observe qubits, their states collapse. These
    properties of quantum computers make them useful in solving complex algorithms
    and make information on quantum computers more secure. However, they also make
    error correction harder as we cannot observe or copy over the information easily.

  zh: 我们讨论了为什么量子计算机中的错误纠正比经典计算机更困难。量子比特的叠加性质使我们更难以捕捉它们的状态。当我们观察量子比特时，它们的状态会坍缩。量子计算机的这些属性使它们在解决复杂算法方面很有用，并使量子计算机上的信息更安全。然而，它们也使得错误纠正更加困难，因为我们无法轻松观察或复制信息。
- en: We touched upon techniques like using shorter circuits and using certain code
    for certain algorithms and NISQ in detail in this chapter. Sam brought these complex
    concepts to life with a simplified articulation. He described error correcting
    of the methods and touched upon the impact some of the breakthroughs could have
    on quantum computing. We also discussed applications that are possible when error correction
    within quantum computers is no longer such a big barrier. For instance, modeling
    Nitrogen fixation in computers can help the world in many ways.

    using quantum computers, we will be able to understand better the feasibility
