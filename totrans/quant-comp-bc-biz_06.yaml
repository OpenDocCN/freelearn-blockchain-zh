    One of the patents (patent number 10095981) focuses on solutions using a multi-state
    quantum optimization engine. The engine calls different quantum devices based
    on the tasks to be solved. The devices called by the engine could be an annealer,

    to address both the developed markets and the emerging world. The scale of the
    challenges is big enough that it is not enough to just use individual technologies
    and provide piecemeal solutions.

    plans is a major leap in healthcare capabilities. The modeling of protein behavior
    can help us create drugs that would solve degenerative neural conditions such
    as Alzheimer's. The efficiencies that quantum computing can bring to the drug
    discovery process can shrink the trial period from over a decade to a few years,
    effectively saving billions of dollars.

    used. IoT and data-capturing healthcare devices are needed to receive health data
    from patients. This information must be safely and securely stored in a system.
    It is then important to use this data to create intelligent insights. Diagnosis
    and decisions on treatments will need to be made based on this intelligence using
    machine learning. This entire process could be tracked on a Blockchain to provide
    the right levels of transparency and privacy at the same time. There are still
    protocol level improvements, on chain and off chain designs needed to overcome
    regulatory challenges using Blockchain. However, as the technology matures, and
    several architectural solutions evolve, data regulations should no longer be a
    stumbling block for healthcare.

- en: Over the course of writing this book, I have had conversations with healthcare
    experts across the globe. One discussion that has had the most impact was my interview
    with Dr. B. Rajathilagam, my professor. Maybe, I related more to it because I
    spent four years of my life in and around those villages. Maybe it is more inspiring
    because it is a healthcare application. But most of all, maybe, that is where
    we could help save lives and see tangible results on a daily basis.
