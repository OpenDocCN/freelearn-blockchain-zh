    Leading organizations are already exploring the possibilities of blockchain. With
    this book, you will learn how to build end-to-end, enterprise-level **decentralized
    applications** (**DApps**) and scale them across your organization to meet your
    company's needs.

    ecosystem with some real-world examples. This is an extensive end-to-end book
    covering every aspect of blockchain, such as its applications for businesses and
    developers. It will help you be aware of the process flows so you can incorporate
    them into your own enterprise. You will learn how to use J.P. Morgan's Quorum
    to build blockchain-based applications. You will also be introduced to how to
    write applications that can help communicate in enterprise blockchain solutions.
    You will learn how to write smart contracts that run without censorship and third-party
    interference.
