- en: Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger with applications in industries
    such as finance, government, and media. This Learning Path is your guide to building
    blockchain networks using Ethereum, JavaScript, and Solidity. You will get started
    by understanding the technical foundations of blockchain technology, including
    distributed systems, cryptography and how this digital ledger keeps data secure.
    Further into the chapters, you’ll gain insights into developing applications using
    Ethereum and Hyperledger. As you build on your knowledge of Ether security, mining
    , smart contracts, and Solidity, you’ll learn how to create robust and secure
    applications that run exactly as programmed without being affected by fraud, censorship,
    or third-party interference. Toward the concluding chapters, you’ll explore how
    blockchain solutions can be implemented in applications such as IoT apps, in addition
    to its use in currencies. The book will also highlight how you can increase blockchain
    scalability and even discusses the future scope of this fascinating and powerful
    technology. By the end of this Learning Path, you'll be equipped with the skills
    you need to tackle pain points encountered in the blockchain life cycle and confidently
    design and deploy decentralized applications.
