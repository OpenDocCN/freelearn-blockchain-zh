    also the timeline of its research. However, the most common definition is as follows—AI is
    the intelligence and capability exhibited by a computer to perceive, learn, and
    solve problems, with minimal probability of failure.

    time than humans has made computers the cornerstone of automation across various
    industries. The computational work of humans is often prone to errors, is time-consuming,
    and exhibits diminishing accuracy as the problem gets harder to solve. However,
    computers have been able to fill this role for a long time, from the early beginnings
    of automation that can be observed in many passive forms in our daily life. One
    of the best examples of such automation is the introduction of **Optical Character
    Recognition** (**OCR**), which converts embedded text in an image or document
    into a text source ready for computation. Computers enabled with OCR devices are
    more accurate and consume less time in reproducing the content than humans. Similarly,
    barcode scanners have led the way to faster checkout times at retail shops. Although
    the early systems were not completely *intelligent* per se, they are still recognized
    for their efficiency.

    can be observed in art, literature, and computer science dating back to as early
    as the 4th century BC in Greek mythology. AI research and development gained mainstream
    progress in the early 20th century. The phrase **artificial intelligence** was
    coined during a summer workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956 in New Hampshire.
    The workshop was called the **Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial
    Intelligence** and was organized by Prof. John McCarthy, one of the mathematics
    professors at **Massachusetts Institute of Technology** (**MIT**). This workshop
    led to the development of AI as a special field within the overlapping disciplines
    of mathematics and computer science.

    the British mathematician Alan Turing had proposed the concept of the **Turing
    machine**, a computational model that can process algorithms, in 1936\. He later
    published the paper *Computing Machinery and Intelligence* ([https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf))
    in which he proposed the concept of differentiating the response of machine intelligence
    from a human. This concept is widely known as the **Turing test** today.

    of ELIZA, a new range of expert systems and learning patterns evolved over the
    next two decades until the 1980s.

    narrow and repetitive tasks. Weak AI functions are based on a preexisting combination
    of logic and data. User inputs are processed based on the same logic, and hence,
    weak AI lacks self-consciousness and aggressive learning abilities. Some prominent examples
    of weak AI implementations are voice assistants, chatbots, and linguistic expert
    systems. Due to the narrow implementation of logic, weak AI is suitable for scenarios
    where the user’s inputs and expected outputs are well defined.

    the information required to convert the textual input into some form of action.
    Chatbots are generally applied in the areas of e-commerce and support where human
    intervention may not be necessary all the time. In the case of online shopping,
    the presence of a chatbot provides a personal touch to the user and provides the
    user with a traditional way of communicating with the system instead of conventional
    searching. Similarly, in the case of support, the application of chatbots can
    reduce the per capita cost of maintaining a support team for a product. It is
    also important to realize that newer generations of users are more prone to communicating
    via messaging over conventional phone calls. Chatbots can leverage this cultural
    shift and also reduce the potential friction involved in the support process.

    and aided by its cognitive abilities. Strong AI has been one of the more prominent
    fields of research due to its potential ability in cutting down operational costs

    dominance of computers over human thinking. Although super AIs are nonexistent,
    there are a handful of institutions and organizations preparing for the leap from
    AGI to super AI, with extraordinary focus on genetic engineering, artificial digital
    neurons, and quantum computing. The application of super AI is surprisingly unclear

    business and is interested in leveraging AI for better insights. We'll begin by
    understanding the topline information of the dairy business by identifying the
    products and revenue, followed by specific information on raw materials sourced
    from many areas. The data extraction process also includes the identification
    of business processes with key checkpoints.
