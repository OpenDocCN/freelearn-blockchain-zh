- en: Welcome to day six. Today, we're going to be implementing the last and most
    critical piece to our blockchain application, the wallet. A wallet gives the players
    of our game not only a place to store their funds, but a way to send and receive
    those funds, and cryptographically signed transactions ensuring that we can validate
    those funds and transactions came from that wallet.

    a website and they''ll add some items to their cart, and then they''ll initiate
    the checkout process. They''re going to have to enter their credit card number
    on that site, but what happens to that credit card number: was it sent securely
    to the server? And, is the merchant going to store that credit card number? If
    they do, are they following good security practices? And, who has access to that
    number now, because anyone with that card number can use it? Well, we have mechanisms
    in place to deal with all of this, and in the event that something happens most
    merchants and card issuers will work with you to resolve the issue, but that''s
    not done out of the kindness of their heart; you''re paying for that service every
    day in the form of fees and transaction costs:'

    shopping process will look the same. You add items to your cart and then start
    the checkout process, but when you check out, you don't enter a credit card number,
    you use your wallet to cryptographically sign a transaction containing the instructions
    for that purchase. So, was it done securely? Hopefully it was, but if not it really
    doesn't matter because the only thing you sent was a signed transaction with the
    details of the purchase, and if anyone intercepts and changes that transaction
    along the way, that signature is no longer valid.

    it''s also going to get stored on the public blockchain, and that''s okay because
    it''s just the details of the transactions; nothing in there can be used to create
    additional transactions. And, what about the merchants'' security practices? Well,
    the contract you interact with is on the public blockchain where it can be viewed
    and audited for security, and finally your private key never left your wallet,
    so the only way your account can be used to create malicious transactions is if
    you lose control of that private key. So, there''s no third party involved to
    charge you account maintenance and monitoring fees:'

    you to interact with blockchains to sign transactions that may include sending
    and receiving currency, or executing smart contracts. They don't actually store
    any currency; they can only reference transactions on the blockchain tied to that
    address.

    key: think of the public key as a street address to your house, and the private
    key as the key that can unlock the mailbox. Anyone can send something to your
    mailbox using your public key, but only someone with the private key can unlock

    to your asset by either calling a locksmith, talking to tech support, or going
    to the bank to get a new debit card. In blockchain technologies though, if you
    lose that private key, it's over; there's simply no way to recover a private key
    that's been lost, and that's by design. Any scenario where you can regain access
    once lost is because there's a middleman somewhere who still has access, whether
    that's the bank, the locksmith, or the email provider, and you pay for that convenience.
    With blockchain, there's no middleman and you own responsibility of your own account;
    the benefit of this ownership is your account can't be hacked unless you allow
    it to happen, and you don't pay a third party transaction fee for the convenience
    of using your money.

    trying to accomplish. In this book, we're going to use MetaMask, because it provides
    a great balance of security and ease of use. Personally, I use multiple wallets
    where each has a different role. I have a mobile wallet on my phone with just
    a little bit of currency on it that I can use for transactions on the fly, and
    I also have a hardware wallet where I store the bulk of my cryptocurrencies; I
    keep it locked in a fire safe and it's backed up with a paper wallet that's stored
    in a separate physical building, so that if something were to happen to it I still
    have a way to access those funds. Well, now that you have an idea of what wallets
    are and how they're used, let's jump into the next section and configure our wallet

    securely sign transactions. The account info is stored locally where MetaMask
    is installed, and it's encrypted on the hard drive. The feature we're most interested
    in today is that it allows the browser to interact with Ethereum applications.
    Each transaction prompts the user to confirm and sign the transaction.

    rate, and that's because we're paying for the computational power required to
    execute a transaction on the blockchain. This transaction can be a simple monetary
    transfer, or it can be a complex processing of business logic built into your
    contract, and the amount of computational power is different for each of those
    scenarios, so the amount of gas paid is different as well.

    brings us to the gas price. Gas price is the amount of Ether you're willing to
    pay for each unit of gas consumed; you can set that to anything you want and likewise
    the miners can choose to ignore any transactions below their set gas price, which
    gives them the ability to skip processing any transactions that won't be profitable
    for them. If you set your gas price too low, miners are going to ignore it and
    your transaction will never get confirmed and be written to the blockchain.

    to pick it up as the gas price set is lower than what they're willing to accept.
    If we click on the MetaMask icon and then go down to the transactions here, it
    will actually tell me that I can increase the gas price, if I want to give that
    transaction a better chance of succeeding. So, how much should you set the gas
    price to? Well, MetaMask actually does a great job of estimating the gas price,
    and you should set a fair value here because gas price multiplied by gas costs
    is what you will pay for the transaction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you set your gas price too low, as we just saw, no one is going to process
    your transaction, and if you set it too high, you'll pay too much in transaction
    fees. There's also a gas limit, and that's the maximum amount of gas that can
    be consumed for your transaction. So, it's okay to actually set this higher because
    you only pay for the actual work done; if you set a high gas limit and it's not
    all consumed, the remaining gas is refunded back to you, but if you hit the gas
    limit for your transaction and there's still more work to do in your transaction,
    you run out of gas, and this counts as a failed transaction. So now, the miner
    actually did perform the work that you requested and they stopped when they reach
    the maximum amount of gas that you said you were willing to spend; as a result,
    the transaction fails and you're not going to get the Ether paid for gas back
    because they did the work they said they were going to do.

    I'll never get that transaction. We saw in the last section that the buyer is
    going to see in their wallet that the transaction hasn't been confirmed, but what
    about me? How can I be certain this transaction is going to succeed? Well, I can
    use the website [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) and see the block height
    for a transaction. The block height is the number of blocks written to the blockchain,
    since the block containing your transaction.

    So, transactions are verified by miners and then written to a block, subsequent
    blocks are written to the end of that block, and the number of blocks after the
    block containing your transaction is known as the **block height**. The larger
    the block height, the less likely it is that your transaction will be reverted.
    Blocks are mined every 12 to 15 seconds currently, so it doesn't take long to
    get a few confirmations. For large transactions though, it's advised that you
    wait for at least six confirmations before considering the transaction successful.

    the transaction status, whether it was successful or failed, the block height
    (which you now know is how many blocks have been written since this transaction
    was included in the blockchain), and we have who it''s from and who it''s to;
    in this case, the transaction was to the CryptoKiddiesCore contract, and we can

    and the costs:'

    and view all the other transactions made from that address. That's why Ethereum
    is known as pseudonymous, not anonymous; all transactions are public but we don't
    know the actual identity of this individual. Etherscan also has sites for the
    common test nets Ropsten, Kovan, and Rinkeby, which makes it really helpful as
    a tool when you're troubleshooting transactions outside of your own local Ganache
    network. And, armed with that information, you're able to verify that any transaction
    on the Ethereum network is valid and confirmed before taking action on a transaction.
    So now, let's dig a little deeper into offline and online wallets so you have
    a better understanding of how each of those work.

    much. By looking at this ledger, you can see exactly what took place in this photography

    piece of technology can be as simple as a piece of paper, because all you need
    to make a transaction is the seed phrase for your wallet. You''ve already seen
    how to do that with MetaMasks so it''s entirely possible for you to keep your
    seed phrase offline on a piece of paper, enter it into MetaMask when you need
    to make a transaction, and then remove the account from MetaMask. You can''t get
    much better security against hacking than not having your information online at
    all. Meanwhile, if this is the account for your online business using Ethereum,
    your business can stay online and continue to work day and night, and all of the
    funds earned by your business will be recorded into the decentralized ledger,
    and you can remain confident that those funds will be there when you want them.
    The downside to offline wallets is convenience; it''s definitely not convenient
    to have to set up a wallet every time you want to make a transaction, and you
    likely don''t want to carry this little piece of paper around with you everywhere.

    with the hardware wallet. Now, this is where it can get confusing because the
    term "hardware wallet" seems to indicate that the funds are stored on the wallet,
    but they''re not. What''s actually stored on the wallet is the private key used
    to sign the transactions associated with the wallet address. Any transactions
    created are sent to the blockchain where the ledger for your account gets updated;
    this means that once you unplug your hardware wallet from your computer, there''s
    no way any additional transactions can be placed from your account. Hardware wallets
    also have a seed phrase just like the ones we''ve used with Ganache, so you can
    write that seed phrase down on a paper wallet, and if this device ever becomes
    damaged use the seed phrase to restore it to a new device:'

    key associated with a MetaMask wallet is stored on the computer where it''s installed,

    it. But, computers crash right? Well, with MetaMask you can back up that private
    key, which allows you to restore it onto another computer or even use it on multiple
    computers. The most important feature of MetaMask for us in this book, is it integrates
    with the browser, and this provides a seamless interaction between the DApp that
    we created and the user''s Ethereum wallet, plus an added level of security for
    the user because we didn''t directly access their wallet, we created a transaction
    and MetaMask presents the transaction to the user with the option to confirm and
    sign the transaction or reject it. Well, here''s the thing: you don''t have to

    bit so that before you're allowed to read anything from there Ethereum account
    you have to prompt them and get their permission first. And, what happens here
    is we're checking for the Web3 provider to be injected into the browser by MetaMask;
    if it is, then we're going to set a variable called `currentProvider` that's equal
