    mining is performed only by blockchains with a PoW based consensus system. Transactions
    are confirmed by the consensus system, and blocks of these transactions are created
    to be added to the blockchain; once a new block is added to the blockchain, which
    is commonly known as **block is found**, there is a certain reward, which is given
    to the miner for performing the task of adding the block in the blockchain; the
    process is not that simple, though. These blocks are added after performing a
    resource-intensive validation process to validate a transaction. The resource-intensive
    task is basically the hashing of certain algorithms associated with the currency.

    power of miners increases, the difficulty has to be increased in the same proportion.

    mechanisms as well. Proof of Work, however, is the most widely used consensus
    system used in cryptocurrencies.

    used previously to restrain denial-of-service attacks, spams, and other networking-related
    issues that currently persist in the system, since they require proof of computational
    work from the requester before delivering the required service. This makes such
    networking-related attacks infeasible.

    difficult to perform by the service requester but easy to check by the service
    provider. Hashcash is one of the systems that first started using PoW-based protocols
    utilizing the SHA-256 algorithm. With it, users had to submit the proof of calculating
    thousands of hashing operations before providing them the required service; this
    in turn limited DoS and spam attacks.

    these are the coins that are created to be a part of the blockchain network. This
    unique type of transaction is known as a coinbase transaction. Also, in a Bitcoin
    blockchain, the coins created in the coinbase transaction cannot be spent until
    it receives at least 100 confirmations in the blockchain. Since the block time
    is 10 mins, 100 transactions would roughly take 16 hours and 40 minutes. The coinbase

    increases. Pools are groups of miners who come together to mine a block, and once
    a reward is given for successfully mining the block, the reward is split among
    the miners who mined in the pool; there are various ways in which the payment
    of the reward is split, and we will be discussing these methods in the next section.
    The reason for having various reward split methods is because hashing is a purely
    brute-force-based mechanism, hence it is pure luck for any miner to find the correct
    nonce and then go ahead with the process of successfully submitting a block in
    the blockchain, so it would be unfair for other miners in the pool if their hashing
    and mining efforts go unaccounted for. Hence, on the basis of hashing power, the
    reward is split, but still there are various methods by which the exact calculation
    of each miner's share is done.
