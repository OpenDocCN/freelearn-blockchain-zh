    a revolution to the mining ecosystem. Further, we will go ahead with learning
    how to start mining using the various miners that are available. We will learn
    in depth about CPU and GPU mining, along with researching about setting up a mining
    rig and the concept of dual mining. Finally, we will study each of the PoW algorithms
    available for mining, and discuss those best chosen based on hardware resources

- en: Cryptocurrency mining is performed by full nodes, that are part of the blockchain;
    mining is performed only by blockchains with a PoW based consensus system. Transactions
    are confirmed by the consensus system, and blocks of these transactions are created
    to be added to the blockchain; once a new block is added to the blockchain, which
    is commonly known as **block is found**, there is a certain reward, which is given
    to the miner for performing the task of adding the block in the blockchain; the
    process is not that simple, though. These blocks are added after performing a
    resource-intensive validation process to validate a transaction. The resource-intensive
    task is basically the hashing of certain algorithms associated with the currency.

    power of miners increases, the difficulty has to be increased in the same proportion.
    This is done by difficulty adjustment and re-targeting algorithms, as discussed

    is not the only consensus system that is in use; there are various other consensus
    mechanisms as well. Proof of Work, however, is the most widely used consensus
    system used in cryptocurrencies.

- en: The concept of PoW existed long before its use in Bitcoin. These systems were
    used previously to restrain denial-of-service attacks, spams, and other networking-related
    issues that currently persist in the system, since they require proof of computational
    work from the requester before delivering the required service. This makes such
    networking-related attacks infeasible.

- en: For PoW systems to be cost-effective enough, the computational task is moderately
    difficult to perform by the service requester but easy to check by the service
    provider. Hashcash is one of the systems that first started using PoW-based protocols
    utilizing the SHA-256 algorithm. With it, users had to submit the proof of calculating
    thousands of hashing operations before providing them the required service; this
    in turn limited DoS and spam attacks.

    have the input address from which funds are to be deducted in the transaction,
    these are the coins that are created to be a part of the blockchain network. This
    unique type of transaction is known as a coinbase transaction. Also, in a Bitcoin
    blockchain, the coins created in the coinbase transaction cannot be spent until
    it receives at least 100 confirmations in the blockchain. Since the block time
    is 10 mins, 100 transactions would roughly take 16 hours and 40 minutes. The coinbase
    transaction can happen on the miner's own address only.

- en: As more and more miners start to mine for coins, the difficulty of the coin
    increases. Pools are groups of miners who come together to mine a block, and once
    a reward is given for successfully mining the block, the reward is split among
    the miners who mined in the pool; there are various ways in which the payment
    of the reward is split, and we will be discussing these methods in the next section.
    The reason for having various reward split methods is because hashing is a purely
    brute-force-based mechanism, hence it is pure luck for any miner to find the correct
    nonce and then go ahead with the process of successfully submitting a block in
    the blockchain, so it would be unfair for other miners in the pool if their hashing
    and mining efforts go unaccounted for. Hence, on the basis of hashing power, the
    reward is split, but still there are various methods by which the exact calculation
    of each miner's share is done.

    very few pools support this system. The miners are paid from the pool's existing

    over the network. Apart from this, its task is to receive work from other miners
    on the network. Based on the operating system the hardware is running, there is
    various mining softwares available, such as BTCMiner, CGMiner, BFGMiner, Nheqminer,
