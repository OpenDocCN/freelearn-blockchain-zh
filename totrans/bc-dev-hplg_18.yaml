    to think about how to apply your newly acquired skills to resolving real-life
    problems.  As discussed earlier, blockchain is considered to be a game-changing
    technology, which can potentially disrupt existing business models by making intermediary
    services obsolete and inspire the creation of new and cost-effective business
    models.  However, this technology can not resolve all issues and its value can
    only be fully realized by combining it with other mature or emerging technologies,
    such as big data platforms, cloud computing, data science/AI, and IoT.

    human history, machines have replaced humans for performing various tasks. For
    example, in agriculture, farming vehicles made farming work less labor-intensive
    and greatly increased productivity. In the US, as of 2008, less than 2 % of the
    population directly work in agriculture. They not only supply the food needed
    for the other 98% of the population, but also make the US the biggest agricultural
    products exporter. Examples in other areas include programmable telephone switchboards

    performed traditionally. For example, in 2016, the US alone had 70B debit card
    transactions. In the same year, VisaNet (one of world's largest electronic payment
    networks) processed an average of 150 million transactions a day. With these high
    volumes, even a tiny saving in each transaction can lead to a huge reduction in
    the overall cost of doing business. In the case of stock trading, the complete
    cycle of a trade plus clearing and settlement take three days. A failure in reconciling
    a transaction could result in a significant monetary loss. (Therefore, a clearinghouse
    such as DTCC implements an insurance mechanism to mitigate settlement risks.)
    With blockchain technology, payment processing is increasingly moving towards
    instant payment worldwide. For example, Ripple can complete a cross-board payment
    in minutes. The technology combines transaction and settlement. It dramatically
    reduces the associated transaction costs. The steps of a transaction are visible
    to a requester.  A recent research report claimed Ripple's payment cost is only
    0.1% of the cost associated with a traditional transaction. Similarly, for stock
    trading, since a blockchain implementation merges trading and clearing/settlement
    into one action, there is no longer a settlement risk. An exchange member firm
    will not need to pay a premium for settlement insurance and will not require a
    large back office team dedicated to handling settlements. This will significantly
    reduce the cost of doing business for the firm.

    complicated due to the increasing number of participants and the complexity of
    transactions. The traditional way of maintaining a ledger is for it to be centralized.
    This approach lacks transparency, leading to frequent disputes legally or not
    legally. It is also difficult to identify an error as parties involved in a transaction
    do not have an efficient real-time method to check and verify transaction facts
    against the ledger.  Blockchain technology can resolve the issues seamlessly.
    The decentralized and immutable ledger maintained on the chain virtually eliminates
    any chance of a dispute and brings trust between parties in transactions.  Blockchain
    allows for real-time queries and permits parties to ensure their correctness.
    Unlike the traditional way, where two trading parties kept entries in their respective
    ledgers, possibly leading to discrepancies, the blockchain ledger allows all parties
    to maintain a unified ledger, eliminating the possibility of inconsistencies.

    efficiently. The adoption of blockchain technology can simplify medical data management.
    For example, a patient's medical history, diagnostic information, and test results
    are kept at their respective doctors' offices. Sharing medical information among
    doctors, for instance a patient's family physician and specialists, is time-consuming
    and difficult.  This could lead to a delay in diagnosis or generatre redundant
    medical tests. The blockchain can make data sharing easier, while the confidential
    data is well protected. The detailed medical records can then be aggregated. The
    aggregated information can be made available to medical researchers, government
    agencies, and pharmaceutical or insurance companies. With simplification and worldwide
    access, health data sharing helps promote cooperation among researchers and pharmaceutical
    companies in the development of new treatments and drugs. Based on real health
    data, government agencies can make improved health policies. Medical insurance
    firms can utilize data to calculate the premiums for plans and reduce the cost
    of collecting the required data. The same goes for decentralizing the results
    of clinical trials. In summary, blockchain can revolutionize how health data is
    stored, managed, and shared. It will profoundly impact the development of the
    health industry as a whole.

    Lawyers charge hundreds of dollars for providing legal services to a buyer or
    seller. In New York city, a real estate broker typically charges a customer one
    month of rent, which is often thousands of USD, for facilitating a rental transaction.
    This is quite expensive compared to the limited services provided.  Blockchain
    provides a much lower cost solution with the added value of providing transparency.
    A real estate blockchain network matches untrusted buyers/sellers or tenants/landlords
    for a deal. The scripted legal document, a smart contract, replaces mos legal
    services provided by a real estate lawyer, thus rendering them nonessential. No
    escrowsing accounts are required since blockchain combines transaction and settlement
    into one action. In other words, transferring ownership of a house and payment
    occur at the same time. A similar solution is applicable in the case of property
    rentals. This will lead to dramatic savings in transactions by both parties. Facing

    countries such as China prohibit cryptocurrency trading. As a result, an enterprise
    blockchain solution such as **Hyperledger Fabric** (**HF**) may be preferred since
    its implementation does not involve a cryptocurrency.

    If a use case does not require a guaranteed transaction, then it is not a suitable

    This is particularly true for family physician offices, which are usually small.
    When a patient visits a physician''s office, it is still a common scene for a
    doctor''s office receptionist to search the file cabinets and pull out a folder
    with the patient''s medical history. The records are then handed over to the physician.
    The physician reads the records while talking to the patient. This approach is
    not scalable and risky. A natural disaster such as flooding or fire can easily
    destroy these records.  When a patient changes physician, the old records are
    not transferred. The new physician''s office will set up a new folder and start
    to accumulate the medical history for the patient. Due to the loss of old records,
    some medical tests may need to be redone, resulting in additional costs and inconvenience
    to the patient. More importantly, the loss of history could lead to losing precious

    the physician''s office. The physician''s office makes an arrangement to send
    the information via fax or regular mail. This approach is slow, expensive, and

    solution is needed to build a computer-based healthcare data sharing platform.
    The platform will allow authorized parties such as doctors, researchers, government
    agencies, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical firms to access the medical
    data. Developing such a platform requires a tremendous amount of work. Digitization
    of existing paper records alone is well beyond our capability and requires the

     It is not feasible to host healthcare data on-chain only. It is logical to choose
    the approach of combining on- and off-chain records for saving detailed medical
    data.  In fact, the Ethereum blockchain has already used the idea of maintaining
    state variables off-chain, while having transactions and smart contracts saved
    on the chain. The body of a patient''s medical information can be saved off-chain
    and its hash is saved on the chain.  The hash is used here to prevent medical
    records from being modified without authorization. Each patient''s medical record
    will be assigned with an address. When a patient''s medical record is updated,
    a transaction with the type *update* is generated on chain. A new hash corresponding
    to the updated medical records of a patient is generated and saved on the chain.
    The updated records will have a new address. Similarly, when a user accesses a
    patient''s medical records, a transaction with the type *access* is saved on chain.
    The digital assets of these transactions are the medical records.'

    is an important architectural decision. There are technical and non-technical

    if a DApp solution involves a cryptocurrency, as different countries have different
    laws on cryptocurrency trading. Trying to work out a coin-based DApp following
    these laws is a daunting task and is not worth the effort. The purpose of our
    DApp is to resolve a business problem, not to issue a digital coin. A generic
    public blockchain platform such as Ethereum involves a digital coin or token.
    An enterprise blockchain platform such as Hyperledger Fabric does not involves
    a cryptocurrency.  Therefore, HF should be considered. Since HF is permission-based,
    its consensus algorithm does not require heavy and lengthy computations. Therefore,
    HF provides a higher TPS. It also contains an access entitlement and control component,

    being hacked a few years ago. Attaching on Zaif is a more recent example. In addition,
    protection of a patient''s privacy is legally required. Failure to comply with
    privacy laws will lead to the shutdown of a DApp application and result in costly
    legal suits. To protect a patient''s medical information, we can encrypt off-chain
    data. When a patient grants permission to a doctor to access medical records,
    a temporary key will be provided. The doctor''s office uses the temporary key
    to obtain a masked private key for decrypting the records. The private key should
    not be visible to the doctor''s office afterward. Only the temporary key is visible
    and is valid for a short period of time. A new temporary key will be generated
    for the next access request. The aggregated information may not need to be encrypted.
    However, access to the information is strictly controlled based on a well defined
    authentication and entitlement model.'
