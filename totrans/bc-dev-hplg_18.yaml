    to think about how to apply your newly acquired skills to resolving real-life
    problems.  As discussed earlier, blockchain is considered to be a game-changing
    technology, which can potentially disrupt existing business models by making intermediary
    services obsolete and inspire the creation of new and cost-effective business
    models.  However, this technology can not resolve all issues and its value can
    only be fully realized by combining it with other mature or emerging technologies,
    such as big data platforms, cloud computing, data science/AI, and IoT.

    human history, machines have replaced humans for performing various tasks. For
    example, in agriculture, farming vehicles made farming work less labor-intensive
    and greatly increased productivity. In the US, as of 2008, less than 2 % of the
    population directly work in agriculture. They not only supply the food needed
    for the other 98% of the population, but also make the US the biggest agricultural

    total. With the internet, new companies such as Netflix emerged and disrupted
    the reign of companies such as Blockbuster. Families no longer need to make a
    trip to a physical rental store to pick up a CD/DVD. Instead, they can downloaded
    a virtual copy of a movie from the internet. In 2010, Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy.

- en: Reconciliation of transactions between banks is costly and time-consuming when
    performed traditionally. For example, in 2016, the US alone had 70B debit card
    transactions. In the same year, VisaNet (one of world's largest electronic payment
    networks) processed an average of 150 million transactions a day. With these high
    volumes, even a tiny saving in each transaction can lead to a huge reduction in
    the overall cost of doing business. In the case of stock trading, the complete
    cycle of a trade plus clearing and settlement take three days. A failure in reconciling
    a transaction could result in a significant monetary loss. (Therefore, a clearinghouse
    such as DTCC implements an insurance mechanism to mitigate settlement risks.)
    With blockchain technology, payment processing is increasingly moving towards
    instant payment worldwide. For example, Ripple can complete a cross-board payment
    in minutes. The technology combines transaction and settlement. It dramatically
    reduces the associated transaction costs. The steps of a transaction are visible
    to a requester.  A recent research report claimed Ripple's payment cost is only
    0.1% of the cost associated with a traditional transaction. Similarly, for stock
    trading, since a blockchain implementation merges trading and clearing/settlement
    into one action, there is no longer a settlement risk. An exchange member firm
    will not need to pay a premium for settlement insurance and will not require a
    large back office team dedicated to handling settlements. This will significantly
    reduce the cost of doing business for the firm.

    complicated due to the increasing number of participants and the complexity of
    transactions. The traditional way of maintaining a ledger is for it to be centralized.
    This approach lacks transparency, leading to frequent disputes legally or not
    legally. It is also difficult to identify an error as parties involved in a transaction
    do not have an efficient real-time method to check and verify transaction facts
    against the ledger.  Blockchain technology can resolve the issues seamlessly.
    The decentralized and immutable ledger maintained on the chain virtually eliminates
    any chance of a dispute and brings trust between parties in transactions.  Blockchain
    allows for real-time queries and permits parties to ensure their correctness.
    Unlike the traditional way, where two trading parties kept entries in their respective

    agencies, and pharmaceutical or insurance companies. With simplification and worldwide
    access, health data sharing helps promote cooperation among researchers and pharmaceutical
    companies in the development of new treatments and drugs. Based on real health
    data, government agencies can make improved health policies. Medical insurance
    firms can utilize data to calculate the premiums for plans and reduce the cost
    of collecting the required data. The same goes for decentralizing the results

    inquiries. Keeping these records on paper is expensive since the government has
    to hire a team of office clerks to manage the records manually.Even in the case
    where records are electronically filed, hands are still needed to respond to inquiries.
    With a digital ledger hosted on a blockchain, inquiries can be met via software
    query tools instead of via an office clerk. This solution will safeguard the data

    partners on the network. According to IBM's estimates, an average of 0.9% of its
    2.9 million transactions result in disputes. These disputes lead to around US
    $100 million in capital being tied, up and unable to be put to work to make a
    profit. The capital financing cost for $100 million is not trivial. There are
    also significant costs associated with resolving the disputes. With the blockchain
    solution, IBM can combine data provided by participants in the network and create
    a comprehensive view of all transactions. The blockchain provides strong privacy
    and confidentiality controls via an access-entitling governance mechanism. This
    solution has greatly reduced the number of disputes.

    or rental of the residual value of an item or services to others. For example,
    one may have an underused computer that can be rented out to another user who
    needs a temporary boost in computational capacity. In this case, the blockchain
    sharing market can be used to complete such a rental arrangement. The platform
    essentially allows individuals to run a private rental business on virtually anything
    that is shareable. The blockchain technology-based market is suitable for any
    device whose usage can be conveniently shared digitally, such as a computer. The
    market can be used to facilitate the sharing of general services as well. For
    example, in a European country young people provide nursery services to elders
    in exchange for credits. The accumulated credits can be used to recieve similar
    services when a person becomes old. With the blockchain solution, the person will
    receive digital coins that may be called *ServiceCoin* for the services being
    provided to others and can spend the coins later to recieve a service.  This can
    potentially be a solution to addressing the problem of the high cost of nursery
    care in the US.

    to search for a proper solution. For the previous business problem, a general
    solution is needed to build a computer-based healthcare data sharing platform.
    The platform will allow authorized parties such as doctors, researchers, government
    agencies, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical firms to access the medical
    data. Developing such a platform requires a tremendous amount of work. Digitization
    of existing paper records alone is well beyond our capability and requires the
    involvement of many groups and organizations. Since this book focuses on blockchain
    technology, we will concentrate on the blockchain part of a solution without worrying
    too much about the feasibility of its actual implementation.

    An enterprise blockchain platform such as Hyperledger Fabric does not involves
    a cryptocurrency.  Therefore, HF should be considered. Since HF is permission-based,
