    will discover how blockchain disrupted businesses, bringing transparency and enabling
    traceability across supply chains, how cryptoassets are redesigning business models
    with tokenization, bringing liquidity and digital representation of any given

    age where monitoring and preventing fake communications has become more and more

    In France, it represented an €8 billion loss in 2017, according to the National
    Delegation to Combat Fraud (DNLF) ([https://www.lejdd.fr/Economie/la-caisse-des-depots-engie-edf-et-la-poste-sallient-dans-la-blockchain-3898162](https://www.lejdd.fr/Economie/la-caisse-des-depots-engie-edf-et-la-poste-sallient-dans-la-blockchain-3898162)).
    This problem was taken over by KeeeX, a French startup that developed a product
    to allow companies and individuals to certify any given file. Founded in 2014,
    they use the Bitcoin blockchain to seal any kind of digital file. When someone
    needs to verify the authenticity of that file, they use the KeeeX application
    to reveal its genuineness.

- en: The explanation is that companies and individuals can rely on blockchain to
    ensure that electronic documents and data can be trusted because it was recorded
    by the right person in the first place. As a reminder, blockchain is a sort of
    distributed database in which data is timestamped and recorded in a consensual
    manner. Because this registry is transparent, it allows users to browse history
    to retrieve a transaction or information seamlessly. By design, these characteristics
    are very useful to authenticate data sources and trustworthiness.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: KeeeX's product is a very powerful and simple example to understand hash functions
    and distributed ledger technology. The process starts with the original file being
    encrypted with a hash function that returns a cryptographic number. This hash
    is sent through a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, timestamped, and appended
    to a block. This means that, whenever someone claims to be the author of the original
    file, a simple search of the cryptographic number into the blockchain returns
    its timestamp and address. With this information, it becomes straightforward to
    point out the rightful issuer, the genuine document, and the date it was submitted.

    is to provide a digital signature attached to the song that links to the creator.

    algorithms, blockchain provides trust and security to the members of the network

    of a given event.

    of data between entities upon the customer's consent. Once a first authorization
    of sharing personal credentials has been granted by the customer to the third-party

    as a license to access the customer's information held by the third party.

    system operated by major energy and utility companies. It consists of a main grid
    in which energy is produced at large power stations and distributed to consumers
    through a wide transmission network. Although electrical grids are widespread,
    1.4 billion people are still not connected to an electrical grid according to
    the Swedish Institute of International Affairs. The smaller grids (the microgrids)
    are linked to localized power sources in a decentralized pattern. For example,
    buildings of a given neighborhood with their own solar panels might be connected
    to nearby residences. Distributed energy resources combined with smart microgrids
    provide an intelligent production and energy transfer within a community.

    such as venture capital funds, business angels, hedge funds, or asset management
    firms. But ICOs diverted these services by erasing frictions and bringing speed

    equity shares like a traditional IPO, hence reducing the power of the investors
    and relationships with project leaders, we then witnessed the emergence of **Security
    Token Offerings** (**STOs**). Through STOs, a fraction of companies' capital is
    tokenized to increase liquidity and accessibility for individual investors. This
    process replaces the expensive and time-consuming traditional IPO to offer an
    affordable means to sell equity shares, threatening another core business for
    investment banks. Not every company can afford to go public, but STOs now enable,
    through the issuance of tokens, sales of financial instruments such as equity

    security tokens were issued at £0.50 each on the London Stock Exchange. These

    its first STO for a startup called Tako (a car-sharing company) and succeeded
    in raising €475,000 in two months at the beginning of 2019\. Concretely, Kriptown
    created a **special purpose vehicle** (**SPV**), which acquired shares of Tako's
    equity, which was then digitally represented on a blockchain—in other words, tokenized.
    Investors could purchase tokens representing a part of the SPV and could then
    be traded on a secondary market. This blockchain-based operation and tokenization
    provide many upsides. First, settlement periods, which usually take several weeks
    in private markets, are taken down to minutes. Second, KYC and AML procedures
    are much more facilitated as well as complying with European norms, which, as
    a consequence, allow large cost savings for the issuing company. Last, but not

    other companies such as Spotify, Uber, Vodafone, Visa, and Coinbase have joined
    the movement and sit on the executive board of the Libra Foundation, a Switzerland-based
    entity legally bearing the project. All participants, including Facebook, will
    have equal rights in the management of the association. The Libra coin will take
    the form of a stablecoin, a coin backed by a real stock of assets like dollars,
    euros, or bonds. This means that the price of the Libra will not fluctuate according
    to supply and demand but rather the price of the basket on which it is based.
    To constitute this basket, each member agreed to bring $10 million to the Libra
    Foundation. Besides the cryptocurrency itself, the Libra Foundation plans to create
    a myriad of services and applications based on the Libra token. In other words,
    they will create an entirely new financial system in which Facebook will be able
    to become an independent financial structure, a kind of bank that offers financial
    services to its customers. And what better service provider than the company that
