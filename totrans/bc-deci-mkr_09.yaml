    applications that have been implemented in various sectors of the economy. We
    will discover how blockchain disrupted businesses, bringing transparency and enabling
    traceability across supply chains, how cryptoassets are redesigning business models
    with tokenization, bringing liquidity and digital representation of any given
    physical asset, and, finally, how smart contracts can replace intermediaries and
    offer seamless transactions between companies and individuals.

    In France, it represented an €8 billion loss in 2017, according to the National

    distributed database in which data is timestamped and recorded in a consensual

- en: KeeeX's product is a very powerful and simple example to understand hash functions
    and distributed ledger technology. The process starts with the original file being
    encrypted with a hash function that returns a cryptographic number. This hash
    is sent through a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, timestamped, and appended
    to a block. This means that, whenever someone claims to be the author of the original
    file, a simple search of the cryptographic number into the blockchain returns
    its timestamp and address. With this information, it becomes straightforward to
    point out the rightful issuer, the genuine document, and the date it was submitted.

- en: With blockchain and tokenization, equity crowdfunding is witnessing a great
    advancement that will unlock a wider audience and larger liquidity, as well as
    greater interoperability and reinforced compliance. Kriptown's platform hosted
    its first STO for a startup called Tako (a car-sharing company) and succeeded
    in raising €475,000 in two months at the beginning of 2019\. Concretely, Kriptown
    created a **special purpose vehicle** (**SPV**), which acquired shares of Tako's
    equity, which was then digitally represented on a blockchain—in other words, tokenized.
    Investors could purchase tokens representing a part of the SPV and could then
    be traded on a secondary market. This blockchain-based operation and tokenization
    provide many upsides. First, settlement periods, which usually take several weeks
    in private markets, are taken down to minutes. Second, KYC and AML procedures
    are much more facilitated as well as complying with European norms, which, as
    a consequence, allow large cost savings for the issuing company. Last, but not
    least, secondary markets operating under a common protocol now allow the transfer
    of tokens as easily as sending an email.

    of outstanding securities. Blockchain achieves fast and secured transactions as
    well as eases settlements meanwhile reducing costs and delays. Theoretically,
    blockchain and smart contracts can be used to facilitate every financial transaction.
    For example, dividend payment and coupon payment could be automated through smart
    contracts and stored in a single and trustless place through blockchain, although

    the Libra project, expected to go live in 2020\. We shall stop a moment to discuss
    this initiative since it was covered by multiple main media channels, a phenomenon
    that only happened when Bitcoin's price approached $20,000 at the end of 2017\.
    Basically, the Libra will be a new cryptocurrency exchangeable across the world
    in a costless and almost instantaneous manner. Although Facebook is the initiator
    of the project, it will not be the only participant. As of the announcement, 26
    other companies such as Spotify, Uber, Vodafone, Visa, and Coinbase have joined
    the movement and sit on the executive board of the Libra Foundation, a Switzerland-based
    entity legally bearing the project. All participants, including Facebook, will
    have equal rights in the management of the association. The Libra coin will take
    the form of a stablecoin, a coin backed by a real stock of assets like dollars,
    euros, or bonds. This means that the price of the Libra will not fluctuate according
    to supply and demand but rather the price of the basket on which it is based.
    To constitute this basket, each member agreed to bring $10 million to the Libra
    Foundation. Besides the cryptocurrency itself, the Libra Foundation plans to create
    a myriad of services and applications based on the Libra token. In other words,
    they will create an entirely new financial system in which Facebook will be able
    to become an independent financial structure, a kind of bank that offers financial
    services to its customers. And what better service provider than the company that
    knows you best? Only the future will tell whether this project is as revolutionary
    as it sounds, but, for now, Facebook is legitimizing cryptocurrencies and has
    taken a huge step forward in the ecosystem.

  zh: 我们仍处于区块链应用开发的非常早期阶段。由于区块链尚未成熟，企业难以实现规模化、可用且正在运行的应用。正如2018年高德纳在其《区块链市场指南》中所述，大多数组织处于发现阶段，试图证明其在其行业中的可行性。一些大公司已经启动了若干实验，其中一些成功地转化为试点项目，但最终变为工业化解决方案的只有极少数。希望这些挑战将在未来几年内被克服，随着技术变得更加民主化并且更容易被广泛的市场接受。实际上，我们可以将其与互联网的采用曲线作对比，这是一项在80年代努力证明其在世界范围内有用性的创新，通过大型电信和技术公司的实验，最终被全球大规模采用。以下是来自

- en: Now that we've reached the end of this chapter, you should be able to capture
    the business issues that blockchain solves. You should also have a clear understanding
    that blockchain is not a cure for any woe but, instead, brings trust in a decentralized
    environment, increases reliability between stakeholders, reduces cost through
    disintermediation, and achieves mass coordination through decentralization.

  zh: 现在我们已经到达了本章的结束部分，您应该能够抓住区块链解决的业务问题。您还应清楚地了解到，区块链并不是对任何问题的解决之道，而是在分散环境中带来信任，增加利益相关者之间的可靠性，通过去中心化降低成本，并通过去中心化实现大规模协调。
- en: In conclusion, we shall state that like any other disruptive technology, the
    democratization of blockchain is slowed and challenged by cultural change where
    blockchain is often confused with Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. The absence of
    standardization increases apprehension in the ecosystem which is often assimilated
    as an underworld exploited for illicit activities and criminals. A large misunderstanding
    and the complexness of the technology frighten decision-makers and business executives
    who are reluctant to experiment with certain developments in their respective
    industries.

  zh: 总之，我们应该说明，与任何其他颠覆性技术一样，区块链的民主化受到文化变革的影响，人们常常将区块链与比特币或加密货币混淆。标准化的缺乏增加了生态系统中的担忧，而这经常被看作是一个为非法活动和罪犯所利用的地下世界。人们对技术的误解和复杂性使决策者和商业高管们有些不愿意在其各自的行业中尝试某些发展。

  zh: 概要
- en: Throughout this chapter, we've demonstrated how traceability and transparency
    can be fulfilled collaboratively, securing and enhancing the supply chain and
    asset maintenance in industrial sectors. We also demonstrated how processes can
    be improved in healthcare and food, how interoperability enhanced security between
    connected devices, and how undisclosed information could be shared in a competitive
    environment seamlessly and protectively.

  zh: 在本章中，我们展示了溯源和透明度如何可以通过协作来实现，从而在工业领域确保和增强供应链和资产维护。我们还展示了如何在医疗和食品领域改进流程，如何通过互操作性增强连接设备之间的安全性，以及如何在竞争环境中无缝共享未公开的信息并保护。
- en: You've learned how blockchain brings a robust authentication on a network to
    decrease counterfeit and forgery, mainly in the luxury goods industry and in arts.
    Also, we showed how blockchain enables new business opportunities between competitors,
    just like in the automotive and commercial food industries.

  zh: 您已经了解到，区块链如何在网络上带来强大的认证，以减少奢侈品和艺术品领域的伪劣和伪造。此外，我们展示了区块链如何在竞争对手之间创造新的业务机会，就像在汽车和商业食品行业中一样。
- en: We also demonstrated, through the different sections, that financial inclusion
    increased in emerging markets as financial services on the blockchain gain critical
    mass and that financial organizations were about to be disintermediated as new
    services and value exchanges are created directly on the blockchain. Finally,
    we demonstrated that assets trading was facilitated as all kinds of value exchange
    can be hosted on the blockchain, and that tokenization enhanced tradability, thanks
    to increased liquidity.

  zh: 通过不同章节的演示，我们还表明了随着区块链金融服务的关键质量，新兴市场中金融包容性增加，金融机构正面临被剥离的风险，因为新服务和价值交换直接在区块链上创建。最后，我们证明了资产交易的便利性，因为各种价值交换可以在区块链上托管，并且通过增加流动性，资产的可交易性得到了增强。
- en: In the next chapter, we will have a look at how blockchain is likely to be apprehended
    in the future and how the ecosystem will handle the fast changes the technology
    is bringing to the business world.
