    One of the earliest AIs that was applied to this domain was an expert system called
    **Dendral**. However, Dendral did not become a mainstream application in healthcare;
    one of its successors called **MYCIN** took over some of the challenging problems
    in the domain of medicine for therapeutic treatments. Today, the applications
    of AI and blockchain in the domain of healthcare are crowded by top brass companies
    such as IBM, Microsoft, Google, and other start-ups.

    of America, who passed the Cross Border Health Directive and **Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act** (**HIPAA**) of 1996 Privacy and Security
    Rule, respectively. Despite the strong enforcement of these rules, there have
    been multiple EMR data breaches that have affected millions of users. This can

- en: '**Operational costs and risks**: A high proportion of the supply chain is still
    in paperwork mode. This means that data across the system is highly vulnerable
    to being tampered with. The data in supply chains is crucial for identifying the
    value of the products, including its basic attributes such as validity and shelf
    life. If the paperwork of the shipment has been tampered with, there could be
    a large gap across the value chain. Manual paperwork-based supply chains can also
    attract financial glitches due to potential scenarios such as double billing,
    thereby creating more audit problems and confusion among the stakeholders. Although
    relatively newer supply chain solutions have been effective in digitally transforming
    the paperwork nature of a few supply chain transactions, there are fewer systems
    technically capable of handling potential data loss or forgery in the process.
    Blockchain can alleviate these problems with the help of smart contracts and can
    automate several critical processes.'

    chain are digitally connected using traditional enterprise software, they are
    loosely defined and coupled among themselves. This means that data integrity is
    not treated as a first-class feature. This can be resolved with blockchain technologies
    based on the immutability concepts and ensure that no records can be stolen, withdrawn,
    or replaced with inaccurate data. Since transactional data on the blockchain is
    open, relevant stakeholders can access information and verify the single source
    of truth.'

    closely coupled to traditional finance can also invite other business challenges,
    such as delays in settlements. Businesses in the supply chain heavily rely on
    working capital, and the major source for capital is either through loans or the
    revenue for their services. Enabling real-time payments across the value chain
    can enable faster payment processing at relatively lower costs compared to traditional
    finance. This is a game-changer for the industry.'

    more effectively, there are many business gaps that need to be filled. It is important
    to lower the bar of entry to bring in a diverse set of stakeholders across the
    globe so that they can participate in a globally verifiable supply chain network
    with a vision to increase quality and efficiency and promote transparency. This
    can happen by exposing APIs so that not all vendors have to be running on the
    same blockchain or network; instead, they could simply exchange trustworthy data
    and record them as cross-transactions across the networks for better compatibility.
    Effort must be made to make these products interoperable so that it becomes easier

    of many metropolitan cities and an active market for new purchases. However, there
    have been cases of aggressive land-grabbing, among other serious issues, due to
    bad record-keeping practices and/or corruption. Verifying titles is a cumbersome
    process before transacting on any piece of real estate. We can also observe some
    historic cases where ethnic clashes persist to this day regarding claiming land
    in some places in India.

    trust that newspaper for its information, but also because of its history and
    the reputations of the journalists, all of which can be socially identified. Now,
    consider you are reading a bit from an online magazine – the tables have totally
    turned against you. Although you might be an avid reader of that website, there
    is no guarantee that the article has been published by a credible author. Sometimes,
    there is a good chance that an imposter is posting an article while using the
    name of a journalist who has a good reputation and trust from readers. In these
    situations, it becomes very difficult to evaluate the validity of the information,
    either by the reader or the website publishing the news, since the volume of such
    articles is so high. Blockchain can be used not only to help verify that the story
    is originating from your favorite journalist, but also verify the claims through
    the help of fact-checkers that can learn on their own in real-time.

    enabling trust and transparency. Civil allows both readers and journalists to
    set a level of trust. Journalists earn reputation and approval, making their content
    trustworthy. Readers can decide on which newsrooms they want to trust as their
    source of news. This enables the users to customize their news feeds based on
    their own preference and level of trust; this isn't decided by the vendors who
    traditionally mine the user's behavior data. This also means that newsrooms have
    discovered a new means of raising funds or generating revenue since the traditional
    subscription models have declined. At the time of writing, Civil allows users
    to directly pay the journalists, without a cut. Also, Civil proudly boasts of
    having more than 1,000 journalists across 28 countries and 6 continents. Unfortunately,
    at the time of publishing this book, Civil has shut down their operations. However,

    had was a government-issued photo ID, which was used to avail a few services such
    as rationing and so on. In the second generation of the internet, most of the
    digital services we use are linked to our email ID. This alleviated the need for
    photo IDs but did not become independent of it. Since traditional IDs and digital
    versions of our IDs are being abused in one way or the other, it becomes extremely
    difficult today for users to manage this. This issue of managing identities and
    tying it to a **Decentralized Identifier** (**DID**) has been one of the cutting-edge

    own digital credentials, control them, and manage them using a security standard
    called **zero-knowledge proofs** (**ZKPs**). Let's assume that you were required
    to have more than 1,000 USD in your bank balance to enter a casino. Today, if
    there were such a rule, the only way to verify your balance to the casino is by
    showing your account's statement, which has also been attested by a bank manager.
    You probably do not want to do that because you are exposing your bank balance,
    which could lead to certain social and personal risks. ZKPs are used to solve
    the same problem, in an innovative way – you do not have to show your current
    balance, as long as you have more than 50,000 USD. You do not have to disclose
    your bank balance, but service providers, such as casinos in the preceding example,
    would still be able to verify the fact that you have more than 1,000 USD. This
    is a huge win for user privacy because sensitive data such as your current bank
    balance has not been shared. The same may apply to verifying residential addresses,
    birth dates, and so on. You can find out more about ZKP concepts at, [https://sovrin.org/the-sovrin-network-and-zero-knowledge-proofs/](https://sovrin.org/the-sovrin-network-and-zero-knowledge-proofs/).

    be paid to creating balance in the ecosystem between walled systems guaranteeing
    cost and decentralization guaranteeing accountability, as well as security.

    authenticity, provenance, and legal precedence. Although the majority of business
    operations are now carried out online, we need to identify ways to achieve immutable
    and verifiable mechanisms that can protect us from hacks or leakages of sensitive
    business data.

    who contribute content, and another set of users who seek this content. These
    functionalities are managed by access control and are then stored in a database.

    provide **proof of existence **for a document, very few can customize access to
    the document. This is largely due to the nature of blockchain, wherein the data
    is accessible to everyone.'

    up, there is a need to provide fine-grained control to business owners. The design
    paradigm of blockchain alone does not provide enough capabilities to build such
    systems. Marrying these technologies with existing **Identity and Access Management**
    (**IAM**) systems is the key to integration and growth going forward.

    identified the issues faced by these industries, and articulated the real-world
    applications of AI and blockchain across several domains. We covered these aspects
    across several domains such as knowledge management, real estate, media, identity
    management, and royalty management. We have also covered some special issues that
    are faced by the information security domain and how IPFS can be used to address
    them. I hope that what you've learned in this chapter enables you to develop your
    hands-on skill in terms of observing, analyzing, and developing relevant case
    studies, as well as help you come up with extensive ideas so that you can craft
    better solutions and develop an eye for critical thinking.
