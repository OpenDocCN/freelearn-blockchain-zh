    2009 and 2014, the ecosystem was struggling to reach a certain level of adoption
    to make Bitcoin a reliable decentralized digital currency. Enthusiasts were focusing
    on trading activities, slowly discovering the underlying technology and its disintermediated
    and transparent features. The birth of Ethereum changed many things, fostering
    a stronger commitment from developers and entrepreneurs. New tools emerged such
    as smart contracts and more lately the Lightning Network. Democratization surged
    when cryptocurrencies gained worldwide media coverage spearheaded by Bitcoin's
    price rise, making emulation within the financial realm. **Initial coin offerings**
    (**ICOs**) soared and many blockchain start-ups have seen the light of day with
    several projects successful enough to compete with the world's most valuable start-ups.

    the political background, and the different applications made across industries
    and countries to solve business inefficiencies such as interoperability, data
    reliability, and security. In this chapter, we are now going to cover key insights
    about a possible future based on changes that have already occurred and others
    that will most likely happen to situate blockchain on the technological route
    toward a redesigned and reshaped global economy. Being able to understand the
    development of the technology in the coming years is important for decision makers
    to grasp blockchain's potential in bringing remarkable business opportunities
    as well as enabling growth in the digital age.

    that same year, of which more than $4 billion was allocated to blockchain start-ups.

    Note that we are talking about investments in blockchain, not in cryptocurrencies.
    The crypto bubble, which burst in late 2017, is sometimes compared to the dot-com
    bubble of 2000\. In fact, it is important to highlight the difference between
    the tokens subject to speculation and the financial health of the companies supporting

    an outstanding share but a number of how much an individual is willing to pay
    to access the product or service. That is, if Ethereum's market capitalization

    Ether multiplied by their market price returns the total market capitalization
    of the cryptocurrency, which is the total amount paid to possess Ether.

    is interesting to note that the most valuable companies in the world will probably
    be surpassed by blockchain-based tokens in terms of market capitalization, meaning
