    technology work, we are ready to introduce Ethereum, the first Turing-complete
    blockchain platform. If you are not completely sure what Turing-complete means
    just yet, don't worry, we'll cover it in this chapter.

    technology and cryptoassets, and quickly started gathering a passionate and dedicated
    community of enthusiasts and supporters. A new movement was set in motion by the
    ingenious system Satoshi created. The momentum accelerated at an exponential rate
    and generated a snowball effect of innovation. Further technological disruption
    and breakthroughs in the blockchain space were imminent. These effects were reinforced
    by the open source nature of Bitcoin.

    functionality beyond payments and distributed asset ledgers. One of its key domain
    areas is decentralized computing. The vision of Ethereum's founder, Vitalik Buterin,
    was to create a decentralized global computer, which was implemented through the
    **Ethereum Virtual Machine** (**EVM**).

    altcoins, is its Turing-complete programming language. Turing-complete means that
    Ethereum's programming language can be used to program and run pretty much any
    function or task. This enables a broader range of decentralized applications to
    be created and deployed. It packs a complete set of tools for developers to innovate
    further and build applications and businesses on the blockchain. The Ethereum
    blockchain serves as a backbone infrastructure for an entire economic and social
    ecosystem. That's why the majority of **decentralized blockchain applications**
    (or **DAPPs** for short), at the moment, use the Ethereum platform.

- en: The idea of Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin who was 19 years
    old at the time. Vitalik was drawn into computer games initially, similar to many
    of his peers. His father, also a computer scientist, introduced him to Bitcoin,
    which Vitalik embraced and started exploring with enthusiasm. He co-founded Bitcoin
    Magazine in 2011 and worked as a journalist there. He also collaborated on colored
    coin projects. You probably remember colored coins, which we covered in detail
    in the previous chapter about Bitcoin. They enable basic implementations of smart
    contracts and digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. Vitalik wanted to expand
    the concept of colored coins to enable larger, more flexible and powerful applications
    to run on the blockchain. When he faced resistance to his idea from Bitcoin core
    developers, he decided to launch his own project and to design it from scratch.

    before Ethereum achieved global success. At a very young age, he was placed in
    a class for gifted children. He won a bronze model at the International Olympiad
    in Informatics in 2012 at the age of 18\. In 2013, he wrote the Ethereum whitepaper
    outlining his vision.

    Peter Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and Palantir, both of which became multi-billion
    dollar companies. He is a prominent venture capitalist and was the first outside
    investor in Facebook. With his fellowship, Peter Thiel aims to sponsor talented
    young people under the age of 23, who leave the traditional path of college to
    pursue projects with a high global impact. Such projects can include scientific
    research, start-ups, or social enterprises. With less than 1% selection rate,
    the award is considered more competitive than gaining acceptance to the world's
    best universities.

    co-founders and developers, and to pursue his vision for Ethereum. And oh boy,
    was this a grand vision! The team wanted to create Web 3.0, a more decentralized
    and smarter next generation of the Internet, powered by Ethereum.

    (**ICO**) in July 2014, which was effectively a presale of ether, the native cryptoasset
    of the future Ethereum platform. They managed to raise around $18m dollars' worth
    of Vitcoin, which was the currency they accepted for contributions, and this represented
    the largest ICO at the time. This form of start-up capital raising through crowdsourcing
    was about to experience widespread adoption and parabolic growth over the next
    years. We'll talk more about ICOs later on.

- en: 'The Ethereum whitepaper starts as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*"Satoshi Nakamoto''s development of Bitcoin in 2009 has often been hailed
    as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of a digital
    asset, which simultaneously has no backing or "intrinsic value" and no centralized
    issuer or controller. However, another, arguably more important, part of the Bitcoin
    experiment is the underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus,
    and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of Bitcoin. Commonly
    cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain
    digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments (colored
    coins), the ownership of an underlying physical device (smart property), non-fungible
    assets such as domain names (Namecoin), as well as more complex applications involving
    having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing
    arbitrary rules (smart contracts) or even blockchain-based **decentralized autonomous
    organizations** (**DAOs**). What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with
    a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used
    to create contracts that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions,
    allowing users to create any of the systems described here, as well as many others
    that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of
    code."*'

    use cases beyond payments. Ethereum takes the technology a step further innovating
    upon the pioneer in the space, Bitcoin. A very ambitious plan, isn't it?

    financial instruments, and decentralized applications. Everyone can launch their
    own project and create a digital asset, a DAPP, or an entire DAO using the open
    source Ethereum protocol.

- en: Digital assets on the blockchain are referred to as **smart property**, meaning
    that any physical asset such as gold, real estate, stocks, bonds, art, and so
    on, can be represented by a token, and stored or transacted on a distributed ledger.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, smart contracts enable complex financial instruments and applications
    to be created. In this way, smart property can be included in smart contracts
    and transacted under certain conditions programmed in the contract. Remember our
    trade finance example from the Bitcoin chapter where a smart contract can substitute
    an escrow account and a letter of credit provided by a bank? In transactions where
    product delivery takes time, a smart contract can be set up, so it releases the
    funds to the vendor upon successful delivery of the goods to the buyer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Combining smart property and smart contracts could lead to DAOs where the business
    logic of operating an entire organization is programmed in a complex system of
    smart contracts. For now, it remains to be seen how this would work in practice.

    before Ethereum. However, previous projects were using Bitcoin and other blockchain
    protocols less suitable for the purpose, while Ethereum is specifically designed

    the continued development of the World Wide Web, the number of software products
    and services migrating in the cloud has been steadily increasing. Business models
    and information infrastructure have evolved and adapted to the new paradigm of
    the web. It is more effective and efficient to share and distribute computing
    resources, rather than store and process everything on the same computer. An example
    of this is shown in the following diagram:'

    between the different components of a computer system. At the top level, we have
    hardware and software. Then, we can break down the different types of software
    into additional layers, such as software operating systems and software applications.

- en: A virtual machine is another construct that comes on top of computer hardware,
    or a standard operating system such as Windows, and interacts with various applications.
    A virtual machine basically creates a virtual operating system environment that
    can be separated from the hardware. Just as any other virtual machine in a network,
    it is isolated from a network yet it is a part of the network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or any data corruption. This allows an entire operating system to be copied and
    pasted from one hardware device to another, just as any other file (similar to
    a video, a picture, or a text file). Such virtualization is part of cloud computing,
    which is so popular nowadays. The following diagram shows the architecture of
    the virtual machine:'

    applications share hardware resources from a single host server, or from a pool
    of host servers. Each virtual machine requires its own underlying OS, and the
    hardware is virtualized. A hypervisor, or a virtual machine monitor, is software,
    firmware, or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. It sits between
    the hardware and the virtual machine and is necessary to virtualize the server.

    programming language, such as Solidity, which was purposely designed by the Ethereum
    development team. Turing-complete means that it is general purpose or computationally
    universal, in other words it can be used to program and perform pretty much any

    have attempted breaking through the blockchain platforms trying to steal the cryptocurrencies.
    They have been successful recently with a few others, but not with Ethereum platform,
    because of the EVM, as it has become the platform's shield against the hackers,
    making hacking into an Ethereum platform very difficult. For securing the platforms,
    the EVM tends to secure firewalls of the platform, and reinforces security measures.
    This ensures the safety of the tokens and transactions that are present on the
