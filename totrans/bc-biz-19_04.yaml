    which everyone has been asking and which is central to this book—what is blockchain?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain is a decentralized database, which is distributed over a computer
    network, with each computer in that network storing an identical copy of the same
    database filesystem. In the context of financial transactions, this is also referred
    to as DLT because a ledger is an accounting book or a collection of financial
    records.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In finance, we use a ledger to record all accounting related to a specific entity.
    A company's bank account would have a ledger that contains many, many transactions.
    Every time money comes in, or goes out, a new entry would have to be registered
    in the ledger. In the same way, a blockchain distributed ledger keeps the same
    information related to a series of transactions across multiple computers, forming
    a peer-to-peer network.

- en: The idea of hundreds or thousands of computers storing the same file does sound
    a bit strange at first, doesn't it? It wouldn't be a surprise if your first thought
    was redundancy. But such redundancy provides security and ensures there is no
    central point of failure in the entire system. It protects from attempts to manipulate
    the system by bad actors.
  prefs: []

- en: This in turn provides the opportunity to eliminate any centralization or, in
    other words, to cut out the middlemen. Such decentralized blockchains work through
    a consensus mechanism or algorithm. There are different types of consensus algorithms
    and we'll cover the main ones later on in the book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the moment, it's important to understand that these consensus algorithms
    enable the different nodes (which are basically the participants in the network)
    to verify new transactions and maintain a uniform view of the up-to-date state
    of the ledger.

- en: After new transactions are verified, they are ordered and grouped into blocks,
    which are then linked to previous blocks. Each new block is built on top of the
    last block in chronological order.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each of these blocks is a type of data structure containing information and,
    more precisely, transaction records. Generally, distributed databases can contain
    any kind of data, not just financial or economic data, but blockchain's security
    and design make it especially suitable to use for value exchanges. Hence, the
    expression that blockchain is the internet of value or the internet of money.

- en: Transactions once put on the blockchain are normally irreversible and their
    record is permanent and immutable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: New blocks are created at regular intervals of time and are timestamped. Each
    new block is linked to the chain of previous blocks, hence the term **blockchain**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We should note that Satoshi never mentioned blockchain in the original whitepaper.
    He mostly referred to the technology as a Proof-of-Work chain. The closest he
    came to saying blockchain was with phrases such as the next block in the chain
    or chain of blocks. The term blockchain was popularized by early Bitcoin companies,
    such as [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/).

- en: The usefulness of blockchain technology comes from its security, immutability,
    and transparency. All the nodes have access to the updated and verified information
    stored in the database simultaneously, and at all times. These features enable
    huge potential financial and industrial applications. Both the private and public
    sectors can benefit from blockchain technology. The following sections focus extensively
    on such applications and on the way blockchain can transform industries and businesses
    around the world.

- en: We've already seen that recording information and organizing it in a ledger
    resembles an accounting system. Blockchain is a pretty sophisticated accounting
    system from a technological point of view, but still an accounting system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A blockchain distributed ledger is stored and maintained by an entire computer
    network, rather than on a single computer, server, or piece of paper. This is
    a true element of innovation. If you are still not convinced by the value proposition
    blockchain brings, consider the fact that the accounting system as we know it
    today has existed since the 15th century.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Yes, that''s right! The double-entry accounting system was introduced by Luca
    Pacioli in 15th century Italy. It is based on the idea that we have two effects
    on each side of a transaction: a debit and a credit. This formed the basis for
    company balance sheets, which are ledgers of assets and liabilities (in other
    words, what a company owns and what it owes). By codifying these rules, Pacioli
    provided much needed order and tools to enable enterprises to scale efficiently
    and track and communicate all of their financial information. This is illustrated
    in the following diagram:'

- en: Over time, the complexity of economic transactions has increased, and business
    enterprises and government bodies can find it handy to have some new tools. In
    Pacioli's time, business audits were done regularly, on a daily basis. This is
    not the case anymore. It's impractical to have real-time reporting at the scale
    at which corporations operate nowadays, at least not in the traditional way. Such
    lack of accountability has resulted in a number of high-profile corporate disasters
    and bankruptcies. We've all heard the cases of Enron, WorldCom, and Bernie Madoff's
    Ponzi scheme, to name a few.

    it can provide almost real-time audited reporting to stakeholders and regulatory
    bodies. Imagine how much efficiency and further progress such technology can bring
    to the world!

- en: Think about the current state of the banking system. At present all banks are
    required to do careful due diligence on each and every one of their clients to
    prevent financial crime, such as money laundering and terrorist financing. This
    requirement is called **know your customer** (**KYC**) and takes a huge amount
    of time and paper processing by large teams at each bank. Each bank does KYC separately,
    so the process can be repeated many times over for the same clients if they have
    dealings with different financial institutions. Imagine how this process can be
    optimized if a group of banks shares a private blockchain, where each client is
    onboarded only once, and all parties can trust the information in it. The regulators
    and other government authorities could also access and audit this information
    at any time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another straightforward example that comes to mind is securities trading and
    settlement. Currently, this process involves multiple steps and intermediaries,
    which makes it expensive and time-consuming. When a buyer and a seller want to
    trade a security, such as a stock, they need the involvement of a stock exchange,
    clearing house, and often broker-dealers to execute such a transaction. All the
    trading information also must be recorded strictly and made available for regulatory
    audit. All the steps involved take at least two to three days until a trade is
    settled, meaning that the buyer has received the stock, the seller has received
    the money, and everything is recorded properly. All these processes can be streamlined
    on the blockchain, thus enabling simultaneous trade execution, clearing, and settlement
    in a matter of minutes. And again, regulators could check the transaction records
    instantly at any time.
