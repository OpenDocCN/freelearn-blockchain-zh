    technology—cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is much more than just a blockchain
    application; it makes use of cryptographic primitives such as digital signatures
    to achieve asset management by using atomic events called transactions. Throughout

    how cryptocurrency is different from any of the traditional digital currencies.

    network. It is the best-known cryptocurrency to date due to its resilient software
    and infrastructure, widespread adoption in various fields, and high market capitalization.
    By the end of 2017, Bitcoin had achieved a market cap of 300 billion USD, which
    is the highest by any cryptocurrency to date. Most of the cryptocurrencies in
    the market are inspired by and use similar designs to Bitcoin. We will be using
    Bitcoin to learn about most of the relevant concepts in cryptocurrency, and later
    on in this chapter, we will also implement a cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin.

- en: A cryptocurrency is a digital asset that uses cryptography to secure, spend,
    and verify its value in the transactions. The cryptocurrency could be transferred
    from the owner to any recipient without the need for an intermediary to settle
    the transactions. Although the early adoption of cryptocurrency provided a number
    of features, such as pseudo anonymity, lower transaction fees, and removing the
    need for an intermediary, it never achieved true decentralization. There were
    known issues, such as double-spending. This was when a single asset was transferred
    to multiple recipients because there was no centralized source to verify these
    transactions. All of these issues were addressed when a completely decentralized
    cryptocurrency called Bitcoin was created in 2009\. This solved the double-spend
    issue for the first time in a decentralized network by using immutable blockchain
    to achieve consensus among the nodes.

    and sell goods and services or to just transfer money to people. Bitcoin has several
    advantages over conventional currencies, such as lower transaction costs and the
    ability to transfer currency to any part of the world, because it is not controlled
    by any national authorities. Bitcoin is also entirely virtual, meaning there is
    no physical form of the currency. The value of Bitcoin is generated by transactions
    in Bitcoin. Anyone can transfer Bitcoin to a particular Bitcoin address using
    a transaction. The address of the legitimate recipient of the Bitcoin will be
    identified by a secret key corresponding to the address. The user can then transfer
    the Bitcoin to others by constructing a new transaction using the secret key.
    Generally, a Bitcoin address is created using the public key, and the secret key
    is the private key counterpart of the public key. The keys are generally stored
    in a software application called a wallet, but they can also be backed up and
    stored anywhere if we need better security.

    It utilizes all the concepts we have discussed so far to build a cryptocurrency
    that functions in a completely decentralized **peer-to-peer** (**P2P**) system.
    Because of Bitcoin's completely decentralized network, there is no need for a
    central trusted authority, such as a bank, to act as a moderator and validate
    the transactions. Instead, everyone in the Bitcoin ecosystem participates in ensuring
    that valid transactions take place.

    running this software on a device such as a smartphone or a computer. A lighter
    version of the Bitcoin software can be used on devices where the computing and
    storage capacity is limited. There is a special type of node called a miner, which
    uses processing power to verify transactions and contributes to the creation of
    blocks by solving a hard-cryptographic puzzle. This is a hash puzzle, more specifically
    called the Proof of Work consensus algorithm, which was discussed in [Chapter
    3](6d775eaf-4ee6-4463-b5e9-623f49c80aca.xhtml), *Cryptography in Blockchain*.
    Every 10 minutes, a miner can publish a valid block, which is then propagated
    and validated by everyone on the Bitcoin network. The miner is rewarded in bitcoin
    for the computing power spent creating the block. Due to an increase in competition
    in mining, the difficulty of the puzzle has been adjusted so that the average
    block creation time remains around 10 minutes.

    circulate in the Bitcoin network. There is a limit set on the total number of
    bitcoins that can circulate in the network, and it is hard-capped to 21 million

    elliptic curve multiplication is performed to generate the public key. Elliptic
    curve multiplication is a one-way cryptographic function that makes it impossible
    to derive the private key from the exposed public key. You can explore the mathematical

    spending a UTXO, any excess is returned as one more UTXO to the user. This is
    similar to real-world currency, where coins cannot be broken down into lower values,
    and change is received for the excess amount paid. Let's consider our previous
    example, where Alice sends 0.1 bitcoin to Bob. As we can see in *Figure 5.3*,
    Alice doesn't have a UTXO of value 0.1\. So, Alice spends a transaction output
    of 0.325, which is greater than 0.1\. After sending 0.1 bitcoin to Bob, the rest
    of the amount is sent back to Alice, creating a new UTXO. As we can see from the
    transaction, Alice gets back slightly less than 0.225 bitcoin to her account.

    to make sense of the locking and unlocking scripts. Script is simple, a stack-based
    language that is processed from left to right. It is intentionally not Turing-complete.
    It doesn't have a complex control flow, such as loops, other than conditions.
    This makes sure that the program is executed in a predictable time. This was done
    intentionally to avoid denial-of-service attacks, which create infinite execution
    loops. The simplicity of the Script language ensures that Bitcoin is not vulnerable
    to any attacks of this nature.

    to or after execution. This ensures that execution is not affected by any other
    aspects of the system and that scripts could be executed on any system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Script is a stack-based language because it uses a stack data structure during
    execution. A stack data structure performs push and pop operations on the data
    items. Push operations add an item to the top of the stack, and pop operations
    remove the last inserted item. Script executes the program by processing items
    from left to right. Data items are pushed to the stack whenever they are encountered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Operators pop an item from the stack and perform operations on them, and then
    push the results back to the stack. Script has a huge set of operators, which
    are represented by opcodes that can be used on the items. Arithmetic opcodes such
    as `OP_ADD` perform addition on the top two items, whereas the conditional `OP_EQUAL`
    opcode evaluates a condition, producing a Boolean result. Bitcoin transaction
    scripts mostly consist of a conditional operator whose final result must evaluate
    to a true value if the transaction is to be considered valid.

    and `4` are inserted into the stack as soon as the execution begins. Next, the
    script performs an addition operation, represented by the `OP_ADD` operator. The
    addition operation is performed on the top two items of the stack after popping
    them, so *2 + 4 = 6*. The result is pushed back to the stack. The data constant
    `6` is pushed to the stack when it is encountered. Finally, the conditional `OP_EQUAL`
    operator is performed on the stack items. The last two items are popped from the
    stack and compared to see if they are equal. Since the last two data items in
    our stack are `6`, the equality condition will return a `TRUE` value.

- en: A Bitcoin header has metadata that summarizes all the transactions present in
    the block. This is achieved by creating a digest using a special type of tree
    called a Merkle hash tree. As mentioned in [Chapter 2](bbe822af-c535-4a33-9783-168d174c48c1.xhtml),
    *A Bit of Cryptography*, a Merkle hash tree is a binary hash tree that is used
    to summarize large sets of data. Merkle trees are used to summarize all the transactions
    in Bitcoin and thus ensure the integrity of the transactions. They provide an
    efficient way to verify whether a transaction is included in the block.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Merkle trees recursively hash the nodes, starting from the leaves, which are
    hashes of transactions, until there is only one hash. This hash value summarizes
    all the transactions in the block and is called the Merkle root. Bitcoin applies
    the SHA256 hash function twice to create the hash of a transaction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When there are *N* transactions in a block, the Merkle tree ensures that it
    doesn't need more than *2*log2(N)* calculations to check whether the transaction
    is included in the block. This makes the Merkle tree implementation a very efficient
    way to verify whether a transaction is included, as well as to check integrity.
    Merkle trees are efficient in cases with large numbers of transactions. Even though
    the number of transactions in a block increases exponentially, the path required
    to verify a transaction will always be logarithmic due to the binary tree nature
    of the Merkle tree.

    Surprisingly, the Bitcoin network consists of nodes that deal with multiple public
    blockchains. The main blockchain, which is used to hold transactions with actual
    value, is called **mainnet**. This is the longest blockchain, with the highest
    number of participating nodes. Besides mainnet, Bitcoin has several other blockchains

    purposes. The testnet blockchain works on the same network as mainnet, with features
    such as wallets, transactions, and mining. The only difference is that the coins
    circulated in testnet don't have any monetary value. Testnet was created as a
    test network that can be used by developers to check features and fixes before
    they are deployed in mainnet. Testing on testnet is crucial because it is impossible
    to revert the mainnet blockchain due to the decentralization. Testnet is supposed
    to work with a lightweight configuration by keeping the mining difficulty to a
    minimum so that even simple hardware can be used for testing. But people tend
    to use high-configuration hardware in the testing network, which increases the
    mining difficulty. Every now and then, testnet is recreated by propagating a new
    genesis block and resetting the difficulty. The current iteration of testnet is
    called testnet 3.

    in order to update the global transaction state. Transactions that haven't yet
    been included in the blockchain are called **unconfirmed transactions**. Unconfirmed
    transactions are always locally stored in a pool called a transaction pool. This

    communicate to the nodes. We will add two more message types to the application.

    to understand the true implementation of the blockchain technology is through
    a cryptocurrency application. In this chapter, we have covered all the concepts
    of cryptocurrency with the help of Bitcoin in order to understand how cryptocurrency
    functions in a decentralized network.

    network. Then we dived into several concepts, such as keys, addresses, and wallets,
    used in Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions were explored in depth since those are the
    events that bring value to the Bitcoin network. We also dived into the essence
    of blockchain, including mining and consensus of Bitcoin. Finally, we concluded
    the chapter by creating a simple cryptocurrency application.

    used to deploy a basic cryptocurrency. Now that we are familiar with the key concepts
    of a decentralized application, we will dive into blockchain by creating an application
    using the existing platform in the next chapter.
