    involved will register their transactions on the Blockchain. For instance, in
    a food supply chain where a farmer, a logistics provider, a broker, and a supermarket
    are involved, each of them will be a node. As the farmer hands over the crops
    to the logistics provider, there is a handshake mechanism that authorizes the
    exchange of the crop. The handshake can also include the process of checking the quality
    of the crop.

    the implementation of a Blockchain solution. In existing food supply chains, the

    can't afford the delay, and take cash from the middleman at a massive discount.
    This is because farmers cannot afford to run out of working capital. With immediate
    payments enabled, farmers should get their money within days, if not hours, of
    delivering the crop. This can only make it a healthier ecosystem, not just for
    the farmer, but for all of us.
