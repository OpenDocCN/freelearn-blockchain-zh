    India had the GDP numbers, population, surging middle class, and a higher level

    dealing with the supply chain efficiently is a major overhead.

    involved will register their transactions on the Blockchain. For instance, in

    This is because farmers cannot afford to run out of working capital. With immediate

  zh: 区块链的另一个关键用例是充当车辆零部件的登记处。整个制造过程可以在区块链上注册，包括原材料的来源、供应商、采购和制造步骤。制造步骤可以通过使用物联网设备进行机器级数据跟踪来监控。根据Gartner的报告，到2025年，制造业可以通过使用区块链技术节省1760亿美元。
- en: All this data should be able to provide a traceability mechanism for the production
    line of vehicles. Sensors can keep track of the quality of the vehicle parts once
    they hit the road. The performance of the vehicles can be measured and managed,
    as discussed in previous sections, using IoT devices too. Therefore, when there
    is a faulty part reported, the Blockchain system will know how and where to source
    it immediately.

  zh: 所有这些数据应该能够为车辆生产线提供追溯机制。一旦车辆零部件上路后，传感器就可以跟踪车辆零部件的质量。车辆的性能也可以使用物联网设备进行测量和管理，正如前面讨论的那样。因此，当报告有故障零部件时，区块链系统将立即知道如何以及从哪里获取它。
- en: As a new part is provided as a replacement, a handshake mechanism using tags
    can ensure that the replacement part was sourced from the right vendor. In doing
    so, the health sheet of the vehicle is built from a very early stage and through
    its lifetime. The average cost of a product recall in manufacturing is $8 million.
    This cost can be massively reduced using Blockchain for the end-to-end traceability
    of parts.

  zh: 作为替换提供的新零件，可以使用标签进行握手机制，以确保替换零件来自正确的供应商。通过这样做，车辆的健康表从早期阶段开始建立，并贯穿其整个寿命。制造业产品召回的平均成本为
    800 万美元。使用区块链对零部件的端到端可追溯性可以大大降低这一成本。
- en: A study by Capgemini interviewed 447 manufacturing firms using Blockchain and identified
    that over 60% of them had already changed the way they were interacting with their
    suppliers. Despite all the benefits, there are initial barriers that the technology
    needs to overcome to see mainstream adoption.

- en: The **Return on Investment** (**ROI**) for the technology and operational overhauls
    needed is unclear and often can be a major roadblock in big organizations. Identifying
    sponsors within an organization without a clear ROI narrative can be challenging.
    The other key challenge for adoption as per the Capgemini report is the interoperability
    (or the lack of it) of Blockchain with legacy systems and processes within these
    big manufacturing firms.

  zh: 对于需要技术和运营改革的投资回报率（**ROI**）尚不清楚，通常会成为大型组织的主要障碍。在组织内没有明确的 ROI 叙述的情况下识别赞助商可能具有挑战性。根据卡普吉尼报告，区块链与这些大型制造公司内的传统系统和流程的互操作性（或其缺乏）是采用的另一个关键挑战。

- en: In this chapter, we have covered the use cases that quantum computing and Blockchain
    could deliver within logistics. This is an industry where there are several inefficiencies
    due to a lack of digitization. As a result, it could be a green field for technology
    to create value in.

- en: In the case of quantum computing, the major use cases we touched upon are efficient
    traffic management systems. We discussed the use of quantum computing when connected
    cars become more common. With today's infrastructure, traffic management can be
    achieved using telecoms data/geospatial data.

  zh: 在量子计算中，我们提到的主要用例是高效的交通管理系统。我们讨论了当联网汽车变得更普遍时，使用量子计算的情况。利用今天的基础设施，可以使用电信数据/地理空间数据来实现交通管理。
- en: We also touched upon Airbus' attempts to add efficiencies to the aerospace industry.
    Flight physics can be modelled more accurately using quantum computing than with classical
    machines. As a result, aerodynamics around the wings of the aircraft can be modeled
    and fuel efficiencies can be achieved by optimizing flight take-off and landing.
    In a world being badly hit by climate change, every single bit of saving on carbon
    emissions can help us.

    and traceability. The food supply chain use case is especially interesting as
    it can be both beneficial to the consumer and the farmer in many ways. We saw
    innovation that caters to both ends of the supply chain.

- en: The applications of these two technologies are huge, and the potential value
    addition can't be exaggerated either. However, both these technologies have some
    major challenges to overcome before they see mainstream adoption. They should
    be able to co-exist in a business environment, as the use cases are rather complementary.
    In the next chapter, we will look at how quantum computing and NISQ can be used in
    the field of chemistry.
