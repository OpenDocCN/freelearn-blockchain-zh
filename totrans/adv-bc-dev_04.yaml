    new, but, with the advent of the blockchain, interest in this idea was revived,
    and this is now an active area of research in the blockchain space. Due to the
    cost-saving benefits that smart contracts can bring to the financial services
    industry by reducing the cost of transactions and simplifying complex contracts,
    rigorous research is being carried out by various commercial and academic institutions
    to formalize and make the implementation of smart contracts easy and practical,
    as soon as possible.

    article named *Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks*, but
    it was almost 20 years before the real potential and benefits of them were indeed
    appreciated with the invention of Bitcoin and subsequent development in blockchain
    technology. Smart contracts are described by Szabo as follows:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of a contract. The general objectives are to satisfy common contractual conditions
    (such as payment terms, liens, confidentiality, and even enforcement), minimize
    exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries.
    Related economic goals include lowering fraud loss, arbitrations and enforcement
    costs, and other transaction costs."'

    in 2009, where Bitcoin transactions using a limited scripting language can be
    used to transfer value between users, over a peer-to-peer network where users
    do not necessarily trust each other, and there is no need for a trusted intermediary.

    an agreement that is automatically executable and enforceable.*'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dissecting this definition further reveals that a smart contract is, in fact,
    a computer program that is written in a language that a computer or target machine
    can understand. Also, it encompasses agreements between parties in the form of
    business logic. Another fundamental idea is that smart contracts are automatically
    executed when certain conditions are met. They are enforceable, which means that
    all contractual terms are executed as defined and expected, even in the presence
    of adversaries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Enforcement is a broader term that encompasses traditional enforcement in the
    form of law, along with the implementation of specific measures and controls that
    make it possible to execute contract terms without requiring any mediation. It
    should be noted that true smart contracts should not rely on traditional methods
    of enforcement. Instead, they should work on the principle that code is law, meaning
    that there is no need for an arbitrator or a third party to control or influence
    the execution of the smart contract. Smart contracts are self-enforcing as opposed
    to legally enforceable. This idea might be regarded as a libertarian's dream,
    but it is entirely possible and is in line with the true spirit of smart contracts.

    are required to be designed in such a fashion that they are fault-tolerant and
    executable in a reasonable amount of time. These programs should be able to execute
    and maintain a healthy internal state, even if external factors are unfavorable.
    For example, imagine a typical computer program that is encoded with some logic
    and executes according to the instruction coded within it. However, if the environment
    it is running in or external factors it relies on deviate from the normal or expected
    state, the program may react arbitrarily or simply abort. It is essential that
    smart contracts be immune to this type of issue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secure and unstoppable may well be considered requirements or desirable features
    but it will provide more significant benefits in the long run if security and
    unstoppable properties are included in the smart contract definition from the
    beginning. This will allow researchers to focus on these aspects from the start
    and will help to build strong foundations on which further research can then be
    based. There is also a suggestion by some researchers that smart contracts need
    not be automatically executable; instead, they can be what's called automatable,
    due to manual human input required in some scenarios. For example, a manual verification
    of a medical record might be required by a qualified medical professional. In
    such cases fully automated approaches may not work best. While it is true that
    in some cases human input and control is desirable, it is not necessary; and,
    for a contract to be truly smart, in the author's opinion, it has to be fully
    automated. Some inputs that need to be provided by people can and should also
    be automated via the use of Oracles. Oracles will be discussed later in this chapter
    in greater detail.

    as a contract in a court of law. A smart contract is different in presentation
    from traditional legal prose, albeit they do represent and enforce all contractual
    clauses but a court of law does not understand the code. This dilemma raises several
    questions about how a smart contract can be legally binding: can it be developed
    in such a way that it is readily acceptable and understandable in a court of law?
    How can dispute resolution be implemented within the code, and is it possible?
    Moreover, regulatory and compliance requirements is another topic that needs to
    be addressed before smart contracts can be used as efficiently as traditional
    legal documents.'

    have been programmed to do, and that is fine because this very property of smart
    contracts ensures that smart contracts produce same output every time they are
    executed. This deterministic nature of smart contracts is highly desirable in
    blockchain platforms due to consistent consensus requirements. This means that
    smart contracts are not really smart, they are simply doing what they are programmed
    to do.

    blockchain world emerges. In this situation, natural language is not understandable
    by the smart contract, and similarly, the code is not comprehensible to the natural
    world. So, a few questions arise, how real-life contracts can be deployed on a
    blockchain? How can this bridge between the real world and smart contract world
    be built?

    contract code readable not only by machines but also by people. If humans and
    machines can both understand the code written in a smart contract it might be
    more acceptable in legal situations, as opposed to just a piece of code that no-one
    understands except for programmers. This desirable property is an area ripe for
    research, and a large research effort has been expended in this area to answer
    questions around semantics, meaning, and interpretation of a contract.

    allow a smart contract to be run by any node on a network and achieve the same
    result. If the result differs even slightly between nodes, then consensus cannot
    be achieved, and a whole paradigm of distributed consensus on blockchain can fail.
    Moreover, it is also desirable that the contract language itself is deterministic,
    thus ensuring integrity and stability of the smart contracts. Deterministic in
    the sense that there are no non-deterministic functions used in the language,
    which can produce different results on various nodes.

    functions in a variety of programming languages can produce different results
    in different runtime environments. Another example is some math functions in JavaScript,
    which can produce different results for the same input on different browsers,
    and which can, in turn, lead to various bugs. This is highly undesirable in smart
    contracts because if results are inconsistent between nodes, then consensus will
    never be achieved.

    in a bond trading and payment system called **Ricardo**. The fundamental idea
    is to write a document that is understandable and acceptable by both a court of
    law and computer software. Ricardian contracts address the challenge of issuance
    of value over the internet. It identifies the issuer and captures all the terms

    contains the terms of the contract in legal prose and the required machine-readable
    tags. This document is digitally signed by the issuer using their private key.
    This document is then hashed using a message digest function to produce a hash
    by which the document can be identified. This hash is then further used and signed
    by parties during the performance of the contract to link each transaction, with
    the identifier hash thus serving as an evidence of intent. This is depicted in

    programming languages** (**GPLs**). DSLs have a small set of features that are

    GPLs, are usually not used to build general purpose large application programs.

    and performance of a financial contract. Once the flow has been drawn and completed,
    it can be emulated first to test and then be deployed from the same system to
    the target platform, which can be a blockchain. This is also not a new concept,

    required to control the execution of the business logic; for example, the stock
    price of a security product that is required by the contract to release the dividend
    payments. Oracles can be used to provide external data to smart contracts. An
    Oracle is an interface that delivers data from an external source to smart contracts.

    of the data is authentic. Smart contracts can then subscribe to the Oracles, and
    the smart contracts can either pull the data or Oracles can push the data to the
    smart contracts. It is also necessary that Oracles should not be able to manipulate
    the data they provide and must be able to provide authentic data. Even though
    Oracles are trusted, it may still be possible in some cases that the data is incorrect
    due to manipulation. Therefore, it is necessary that Oracles are unable to change
    the data. This validation can be provided by using various notary schemes, discussed
    later in the chapter.

    be acceptable for a smart contract designer to accept data for an Oracle that
    is provided by a large, reputable, trusted third party, but the issue of centralization

    high number of same information is fed from multiple sources, then there is a
    high chance that the data is correct and can be trusted.

    Oracles can find themselves source data from another blockchain, which is driven
    by distributed consensus, thus ensuring the authenticity of data. For example,
    one institution running their private blockchain can publish their data feed via
    an Oracle that can then be consumed by other blockchains.

    (non-repudiation and integrity) of IoT device's data and anti-tampering mechanism
    on the IoT device, which renders the device useless in case of tampering attempts.

    contract code execution. Smart Oracles proposed by Codius run using Google Native
    Client, which is a sandboxed environment for running untrusted x86 native code.

- en: Smart contracts may or may not be deployed on a blockchain, but it makes sense
    to deploy them on a blockchain due to the distributed and decentralized consensus
    mechanism provided by blockchain. Ethereum is an example of a blockchain platform
    that natively supports the development and deployment of smart contracts. Smart
    contracts on Ethereum blockchain are usually part of a broader application such
    asÂ **Decentralized Autonomous organization** (**DAOs**).

    field and CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV), CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY script operator in the
    Bitcoin transaction can be seen as an enabler of a simple version of a smart contract.
    These timelocks enable a transaction to be locked until a specified time or until
    a number of blocks, thus enforcing a basic contract that a certain transaction
    can only be unlocked if certain conditions (elapsed time or number of blocks)
    are met. For example, you can implement conditions such as "Pay party X, N amount
    of bitcoins after 3 months". However, this is very limited and should be only
    viewed as an example of a basic smart contract. In addition to the example mentioned
    above, Bitcoin scripting language, though limited, can be used to construct basic
    smart contracts. One example, of a basic smart contract, is to fund a Bitcoin
    address that can be spent by anyone who demonstrates a "hash collision attack".
    This was a contest that was announced on the Bitcointalk forum where bitcoins
    were set as a reward for whoever manages to find hash collisions (we discussed
    this concept in [Chapter 6](c49f1747-2096-4ab6-a1e1-334e092ef2be.xhtml), *Public
    Key Cryptography*) for hash functions. This conditional unlocking of Bitcoin only
    on the demonstration of a successful attack is a basic type of smart contract.

    This can also be considered a basic form of smart contract.

- en: Various other blockchain platforms support smart contracts such as Monax, Lisk,
    Counterparty, Stellar, Hyperledger fabric, corda, and Axoni core. Smart contracts
    can be developed in various languages. The critical requirement, however, is determinism,
    which is very important because it is vital that regardless of where the smart
    contract code executes, it produces the same result every time and everywhere.
    This requirement of deterministic nature of smart contracts also implies that
    smart contract code is absolutely bug-free. Validation and verification of smart
    contracts is an active area of research and detailed discussion of this topic
    will be presented in [Chapter 16](d0ef443d-d4b0-4afb-91f4-c5863ea1cf43.xhtml),
    *Scalability and Other Challenges*.Â Various languages have been developed to build
    smart contracts such as Solidity, which runs on **Ethereum Virtual Machine** (**EVM**).
    It's worth noting that there are platforms which already support mainstream languages
    for smart contract development, such as Lisk which supports JavaScript. However,
    another prominent example is Hyperledger fabric which supports Golang, Java, and
    JavaScript for smart contract development.

- en: The DAO is one of the highest crowdfunded projects, and it started in April
    2016\. This was a set of smart contracts written to provide a platform for investment.
    Due to a bug in the code, this was hacked in June 2016, and an equivalent of 50
    million dollars was siphoned out of the DAO into another account.

- en: Even though the term hacked is used above, it was not really hacked, the smart
    contract simply did what it was asked to do. It was just an unintentional behavior
    that programmers of the DAO did not foresee. This incident resulted in a hard
    fork on Ethereum to recover from the attack. It should be noted that the notion
    of *code is the law* or unstoppable smart contracts should be viewed with some
    skepticism as the implementation of these concepts is not mature enough to merit
    full and unquestionable trust. This is evident from the recent events where the
    Ethereum foundation was able to stop and change the execution of *The DAO* by
    introducing a hard fork. Though this hard fork was introduced for genuine reasons,
    it goes against the true spirit of decentralization, and the notion of *code is
    law*. On the other hand, resistance against this hard fork and some miners who
    decided to keep mining on the original chain resulted in the creation of Ethereum
    Classic. This chain is the original, non-forked Ethereum blockchain where *the
    code is still the law*.

- en: This attack highlights the dangers of not formally and thoroughly testing smart
    contracts. It also highlights the absolute need to develop a formal language for
    development and verification of smart contracts. The attack also highlighted the
    importance of thorough testing to avoid the issues that the DAOÂ experienced. There
    have been various vulnerabilities discovered in Ethereum recently around the smart
    contract development language. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that a standard
    framework is developed to address all these issues. Some work has already begun,
    for example, an online service at [https://securify.ch](https://securify.ch),
    which provides tools to formally verify smart contract. However, this area is
    ripe for more research to address limitations in smart contract languages.

    by a detailed discussion on the definition of a smart contract. As there is no
    agreement on the standard definition of a smart contract, we attempted to introduce
    a definition that encompasses the crux of smart contracts.

    between Ricardian contracts and smart contracts was explained, highlighting the
    fact that Ricardian contracts are concerned with the definition of the contract
    whereas smart contracts are geared towards the actual execution of the contract.

    high-quality active research is currently being conducted in academia and industry.
    Some ideas about the possibility of creating high-level domain-specific languages
    were also discussed to create smart contracts or smart contract templates. In
    the later sections of the chapter, the concepts of Oracles were introduced followed
    by a brief discussion on the DAO, and security issues in DAO and smart contracts.
