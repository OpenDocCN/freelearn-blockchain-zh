    of being updated with adversary capabilities. MITRE's **Adversarial Tactics, Techniques,
    and Common Knowledge** (**ATT&CK™**) is one of the widely used frameworks for
    cyber adversary patterns, reflecting the various phases of an adversary's life
    cycle and the platforms they are known to target. MITRE has developed three categories
    to determine an adversary's capabilities mainly—pre-attack, attack for enterprise,
    and attack mobile profile.

    it is important to understand the effectiveness and purpose of a specific technology
    before it can be given a chance. Security stakeholders should take part in privately-held
    security conferences and popular public forums include the RSA Conference, Black
    Hat Conference, DEFCON Hacking Conference, Cloud Security Expo, SANS Summit, Infosecurity
    Europe, World Cybersecurity Congress, Infosec World, the International Conference
    on Cybersecurity, and many more. CISO and CSO should also consider joining some
    of the independent security research companies, such as Gartner and Forrester.

    This takes several human hours to perform the assessment and internal network
    audit. It is critical to understand the concept of network avenues, vulnerabilities,
    third-party channels, business partner networks, DMZ, and so on, before a zero-trust
    approach can be considered. Most of the organizations tend to use default setting
    with most of their application and network devices, which can also be a problem
    in deploying an efficient zero-trust approach.

    so that a better cyber defense program can be planned. The breach-assume mindset
    requires continuous network and application monitoring with an added layer of
    incident-response planning. It is important to segregate normal traffic and abnormal
    traffic, applying appropriate policy and response to each dataset. This entire
    process must be undertaken carefully and precisely, as a small mistake can disturb
    the whole approach.

    transfers. However, since becoming highly dependent on the internet, organizations
    are now continually adding new security layers to defend critical infrastructure.
    Almost all business applications are running over client-server frameworks to
    support existing TCP/IP internet stacks; moving from a centralized database needs
    a high degree of interoperability support and industry acceptance.
