    There are a number of trends and developments that are likely to drive the development
    of the blockchain technology and its adoption in the coming years. As with any
    sort of prognostication, none of the things that we will discuss are set in stone.

    thousands of blockchains and hundreds of blockchain technologies. In such a crowded
    marketplace, it is only natural that the technology will begin to have more purpose-driven
    implementations. Many of the drawbacks of blockchain systems, such as the speed,
    ease of use, and so on, are easier to solve with a purpose-specific blockchain
    system.'

    network built from bitshares/graphene technology. It has a consensus algorithm
    based on witnesses and voting, and the whole operation is designed around hosting
    social and blogging content. While still having many of the features of a public
    blockchain, by being purpose specific, the Steem blockchain is better able to
    function in its desired ecosystem.

    blockchain product that is easy to use and integrate into existing systems.

    How do you enforce the scarcity of rare items online? Many games have been subject
    to duping bugs, where a player can duplicate a rare item over and over again and
    then sell it, thereby making a substantial profit. Blockchain technology solves
    the issue of digital scarcity.'

    However, while there are a few Ethereum-based tokens for gaming, there are no
    blockchains just for video games yet. We expect this to change, as some of the
    most lucrative games around make their money through the sale of in-game items.

    sense. There are already a number of real-estate-based projects under way. However,
    the world of real estate is complex, and the laws concerning title ownership and
    transfer vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is likely that a chain
    built for managing the private/public interaction of land transference will be
    able to successfully supplant the existing legacy systems. Such a system would
    greatly increase the efficiency of property markets. Current markets rely on a
    large number of distinct factors with incomplete information government agencies
    holding land title records, insurance companies checking flood zones and other
    issues, issuing prices, and real-estate sales companies carrying out price discovery
    and advertising. The need for multiple disconnected parties to share in a trusted
    system is a perfect fit for blockchain technology. Improving real estate would
    be difficult, but possibly very lucrative for the company that is successful.

    field. Most of these are running on a public network such as Ethereum or NEO.
    However, it is likely that industry-specific blockchains will evolve, as the legal
    needs and requirements of a regional trucking company are quite different than
    those of international cross-border shipping. The system requirements for each
    space may be very different, yet these systems would need to communicate and coordinate.
    Here is a space where federated, multichain networks might be a good fit. The
    technology to handle cross-chain transfers is still developing. However, despite
    the difficulty of tracking tokens across multiple blockchains, teams such as the Tendermint
    team (the developers of Cosmos) are hard at work enabling precisely that.

    and transferred using a large number of proprietary systems, or even old-fashioned
    paperwork. It can be difficult or even impossible to ascertain the ownership of
    certain intellectual property. In the US, you automatically own any IP you create;
    however, this ownership is not recorded anywhere. It is possible to register your
    ownership, but it's far from effortless. A blockchain-powered IP system would
    enable sites such as YouTube, DeviantArt, and ModelMayhem to create the ability
    to automatically register works on behalf of their users. Once registered, those
    same sites could assist users in seamlessly issuing and revoking licenses. Such
    a scheme would require the cooperation of these large internet sites, but this
    would not be the first time such a thing has happened; many of the technical underpinnings
    of the web were created through industry consortiums looking to increase efficiency
    and interoperability throughout the industry.

- en: While the blockchain technology has become increasingly fragmented, there will
    come an inevitable consolidation. One of the ways that blockchain will consolidate
    is within different industries. As with other standard processes, it is likely
    that each industry in which finds a profitable use for blockchain will begin to
    standardize on one or two key technologies or implementations that will then become
    the default. For instance, in the logistics industry, there are many competing
    projects and standards for the tracking and delivery of packages. Some of these
    projects are being built on Ethereum, others on NEO, and yet more on their own
    private chains. One of these approaches, or a new one not yet seen, will hit an
    industry sweet spot and become a standard. This is because blockchain technology
    is ideally suited for uniting different factors that may not trust each other.
    This sweet spot technology will almost certainly be the result of a collection
    of companies, not a start up. A consortium has a much easier time in not feeling
    such as a threatening competitor, and will instead have an opportunity to pool
    resources and be part of a winning team.

    delivery, and tracking industries. Industries such as document and legal tracking,
    on the other hand, are more likely to have multiple private competitors because
    of the different market forces. Medical tracking would greatly benefit from a
    standardized approach, but market forces and regulatory issues make this more
    difficult.

    boom in the 90''s. The result will likely be similar: A few key projects survive
    and thrive, whereas the others fail and become liabilities for investors. However,
    unlike the dotcom boom, blockchain projects have taken vastly more investment
    from the general public. This could lead to interesting results. One possibility
    is an event similar to the dotcom crash: funding dries up for quite some time,
    regardless of project quality. With retail investors taking some of the damage,
    as well as having the opportunity to continue to invest anyway, the fallout from
    a blockchain crash may not be as bad. However, a harsh crash that may severely
    harm retail investors is more likely to draw a regulatory reaction.'

    Nearly every major country is looking at the ICO landscape and working out how
    best to regulate or capitalize on blockchain. In the USA, the SEC seems to be
    looking at ICOs more and more as a securities offering that will necessitate companies
    to carry out an ICO to provide financial and other documentation more typically
    related to stock offerings.

    blockchain projects, an increasing number of projects that are seeking funding
    will issue security tokens. Investors will inevitably start seeking and demanding
    higher-quality projects, as the low hanging fruit will have been taken and barriers
    to entry will increase. In addition, security offerings tend to come with financial
    disclosure rules and other requirements that will act as a gatekeeper to projects
    that are simply not ready to be funded. The downside, of course, is that it will
    be harder for unknown players without independent access to funds to even attempt
    entry into the market.

    many existing exchanges do not wish to trade in such tokens in order to avoid

    stock-trading platforms of major exchanges and banks.

    to reduce volatility and risk, much like ETFs and mutual funds do for stocks.

    One possibility would be a new insurance product, protecting against negative
    volatility in return for a fee. While in practical terms a similar effect can
    be achieved with futures and options, insurance is a concept more familiar to
    ordinary consumers and retail investors who have taken an interest in the token
    markets. We expect that there will be attempts to bring all of these to the market.

    substantial traction from different projects. Any newcomers will have to not only
    offer a superior technology at the blockchain level, but will also contend with
    the host of tools and existing libraries and tutorials that are already being
    developed. In particular, the Ethereum and Hyperledger ecosystems have a tremendous
    amount of investment dedicated to them, as well as the substantial corporate support.
    Both projects are the only ones to be offered by Microsoft and Amazon as blockchain-as-a-service

    play: IBM wrote much of the Hyperledger fabric and provided it as open source,
    and now provides an extensive consulting service in the space.'

    increase in the number of off-the-shelf products for businesses. Currently, custom
    blockchain development is prohibitively expensive for many businesses, as well
    as risky. Once standard and dominant players become more clear, it will be easier
    for startups to provide targeted blockchain-as-a-service and blockchain integration
    to existing enterprises. It will be at this stage that blockchain adoption genuinely
    becomes mainstream.

    Efficient and accurate cross-chain communication is a critical capability to enable
    blockchains to scale, as well as provide the customized services that different
    ecosystems will demand. While a few approaches are under development, none of
    them have really been proven out in the real world under typical business conditions.
    Once a good solution is found, that blockchain ecosystem will have a huge advantage

    This is part of why so many big companies are pursuing AI projects with such fervor.
    Larger companies have access to more data, and are therefore able to produce superior
    AI results than companies that have less data. Thus, larger companies have a vast
    competitive advantage over small ones if they are able to leverage AI expertise
    effectively. Public blockchains remove this advantage because the same data is
    available to all. In this realm, smaller startups that are more nimble and have
    nothing to lose could leverage this public data to provide new services and offerings
    through proprietary or highly targeted offerings.'

    incumbents who can share data among one another to keep out new competitors. The
    existing cartel would have vast data troves larger than any of the individual
    actors, creating a defensive perimeter around their industry. While the consortium
    members might still compete among themselves, their data advantage would help
    shield them from new market entrants.

    network devices result in millions of potentially vulnerable items that could
    be coopted by attackers. Using a blockchain to deliver software updates, along
    with systems such as trusted computing modules, IoT devices could be at least
    partially shielded from attacks by requiring an attacker to disrupt the entire
    chain, not just a specific device. However, this would take careful engineering,
    and the first few attempts at this form of security will likely fail due to implementation
    bugs.

    movements of their delivery vehicles to a consortium network that broadcasts each
    package movement across the entire network, improving delivery and identifying
    issues. For instance, a truck hitting a roadblock and updating its travel across
    a consortium of logistics firms would allow other trucks to route around, thereby
    improving deliverability.

    trends and forces shaping the technology as it exists today. For those businesses
    investigating blockchain, each of these three major trends will act to either
    encourage blockchain adoption or cause avoidance. We hope that the governments
