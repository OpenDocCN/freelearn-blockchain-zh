    There are a number of trends and developments that are likely to drive the development
    of the blockchain technology and its adoption in the coming years. As with any
    sort of prognostication, none of the things that we will discuss are set in stone.

    thousands of blockchains and hundreds of blockchain technologies. In such a crowded
    marketplace, it is only natural that the technology will begin to have more purpose-driven
    implementations. Many of the drawbacks of blockchain systems, such as the speed,
    ease of use, and so on, are easier to solve with a purpose-specific blockchain
    system.'

    network built from bitshares/graphene technology. It has a consensus algorithm
    based on witnesses and voting, and the whole operation is designed around hosting

    sense. There are already a number of real-estate-based projects under way. However,
    the world of real estate is complex, and the laws concerning title ownership and
    transfer vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is likely that a chain
    built for managing the private/public interaction of land transference will be
    able to successfully supplant the existing legacy systems. Such a system would
    greatly increase the efficiency of property markets. Current markets rely on a
    large number of distinct factors with incomplete information government agencies
    holding land title records, insurance companies checking flood zones and other
    issues, issuing prices, and real-estate sales companies carrying out price discovery
    and advertising. The need for multiple disconnected parties to share in a trusted
    system is a perfect fit for blockchain technology. Improving real estate would
    be difficult, but possibly very lucrative for the company that is successful.

    field. Most of these are running on a public network such as Ethereum or NEO.
    However, it is likely that industry-specific blockchains will evolve, as the legal
    needs and requirements of a regional trucking company are quite different than
    those of international cross-border shipping. The system requirements for each
    space may be very different, yet these systems would need to communicate and coordinate.
    Here is a space where federated, multichain networks might be a good fit. The
    technology to handle cross-chain transfers is still developing. However, despite
    the difficulty of tracking tokens across multiple blockchains, teams such as the Tendermint
    team (the developers of Cosmos) are hard at work enabling precisely that.

    and transferred using a large number of proprietary systems, or even old-fashioned
    paperwork. It can be difficult or even impossible to ascertain the ownership of
    certain intellectual property. In the US, you automatically own any IP you create;
    however, this ownership is not recorded anywhere. It is possible to register your
    ownership, but it's far from effortless. A blockchain-powered IP system would
    enable sites such as YouTube, DeviantArt, and ModelMayhem to create the ability
    to automatically register works on behalf of their users. Once registered, those
    same sites could assist users in seamlessly issuing and revoking licenses. Such
    a scheme would require the cooperation of these large internet sites, but this
    would not be the first time such a thing has happened; many of the technical underpinnings
    of the web were created through industry consortiums looking to increase efficiency
    and interoperability throughout the industry.

    come an inevitable consolidation. One of the ways that blockchain will consolidate
    is within different industries. As with other standard processes, it is likely
    that each industry in which finds a profitable use for blockchain will begin to
    standardize on one or two key technologies or implementations that will then become
    the default. For instance, in the logistics industry, there are many competing
    projects and standards for the tracking and delivery of packages. Some of these
    projects are being built on Ethereum, others on NEO, and yet more on their own
    private chains. One of these approaches, or a new one not yet seen, will hit an
    industry sweet spot and become a standard. This is because blockchain technology
    is ideally suited for uniting different factors that may not trust each other.
    This sweet spot technology will almost certainly be the result of a collection
    of companies, not a start up. A consortium has a much easier time in not feeling
    such as a threatening competitor, and will instead have an opportunity to pool
    resources and be part of a winning team.

    blockchain projects, an increasing number of projects that are seeking funding
    will issue security tokens. Investors will inevitably start seeking and demanding
    higher-quality projects, as the low hanging fruit will have been taken and barriers
    to entry will increase. In addition, security offerings tend to come with financial
    disclosure rules and other requirements that will act as a gatekeeper to projects
    that are simply not ready to be funded. The downside, of course, is that it will
    be harder for unknown players without independent access to funds to even attempt
    entry into the market.

    stock-trading platforms of major exchanges and banks.

    One possibility would be a new insurance product, protecting against negative

    be achieved with futures and options, insurance is a concept more familiar to
    ordinary consumers and retail investors who have taken an interest in the token
    markets. We expect that there will be attempts to bring all of these to the market.

    partially shielded from attacks by requiring an attacker to disrupt the entire

    a consortium of logistics firms would allow other trucks to route around, thereby
