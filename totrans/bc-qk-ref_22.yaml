    is within different industries. As with other standard processes, it is likely
    that each industry in which finds a profitable use for blockchain will begin to
    standardize on one or two key technologies or implementations that will then become
    the default. For instance, in the logistics industry, there are many competing
    projects and standards for the tracking and delivery of packages. Some of these
    projects are being built on Ethereum, others on NEO, and yet more on their own
    private chains. One of these approaches, or a new one not yet seen, will hit an
    industry sweet spot and become a standard. This is because blockchain technology
    is ideally suited for uniting different factors that may not trust each other.
    This sweet spot technology will almost certainly be the result of a collection
    of companies, not a start up. A consortium has a much easier time in not feeling
    such as a threatening competitor, and will instead have an opportunity to pool
    resources and be part of a winning team.

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter, we've discussed the near-term likely future of blockchain technology. It
    is impossible to know the future, but from what can be gauged, these are the industry
    trends and forces shaping the technology as it exists today. For those businesses
    investigating blockchain, each of these three major trends will act to either
    encourage blockchain adoption or cause avoidance. We hope that the governments
    of the world issue clear and well thought out regulation as soon as possible,
    as well as put in place safeguards to prevent fraud. With this in place, this
    technological evolution will have more guidance in terms of how to bring blockchain
    products to market safely and with less risk.

  zh: 在本章中，我们讨论了区块链技术的近期可能未来。未来是不可预知的，但可以从中感知到的是，这些是塑造当今技术的行业趋势和力量。对于那些正在调查区块链的企业来说，这三个主要趋势中的每一个都将起到鼓励区块链采用或引起回避的作用。我们希望世界各国政府尽快发布清晰、经过深思熟虑的法规，并建立防范欺诈的保障措施。有了这些措施，这种技术进化将更加有指导性，以安全、更少风险地将区块链产品推向市场。

    It is unknown what new networks such as EOS and Cosmos will bring to the table,
    as no major chain has yet had the extensive governance models that these systems
    seek to provide. If large-scale, decentralized governance is able to perform well,
    it would be an encouraging development for many systems. For instance, the government
    of Estonia is already doing trials with blockchain for some of their government
    functions.

  zh: 区块链技术总体上将继续应用于不同的行业。目前尚不清楚新网络如 EOS 和 Cosmos 将会带来什么样的变革，因为目前尚无主要链拥有这些系统力图提供的广泛治理模型。如果大规模、去中心化的治理能够良好运作，对于许多系统来说，这将是一个令人鼓舞的发展。例如，爱沙尼亚政府已经在一些政府职能上进行了区块链试点。
- en: Most likely, the current blockchain systems will not be the dominant ones in
    the end. As with most technologies, the dominant systems will be the ones built
    on the lessons learned from the current crop of failures.

  zh: 最有可能的情况是，当前的区块链系统最终不会成为主导。与大多数技术一样，主导系统将是根据当前一系列失败所得到的教训构建的系统。
