    soon find out, Ethereum takes smart contracts and smart assets to a whole new
    level with its complete and flexible programming language. This opens up an even
    broader range of opportunities and futuristic concepts, such as decentralized
    autonomous organizations, which can potentially be managed automatically without
    much human involvement. That said, the underlying blockchain architecture still
    remains similar to that of Bitcoin. This highlights the proven technological breakthroughs
    and foundational importance of the Bitcoin blockchain.

    Ethereum white paper.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first type is purely financial applications that provide complex financial
    products and solutions through smart contracts. These can include insurance, financial
    derivatives, escrow accounts for trade settlement, financial trusts, and crowdfunding.
    A good example for this type of applications comes from a company called Etherisc,
    which is developing insurance policies based on Ethereum smart contracts. They
    have a working product for flight insurance, which provides automatic premium
    pay-off to passengers in case of a delayed or cancelled flight. This solution
    brings a clear advantage to customers as they get their premium paid off automatically,
    with no delay, once a coverage trigger event occurs. Typically, getting a refund
    for a delayed or cancelled flight has been a cumbersome and lengthy process plagued
    by bureaucracy, which can drag on for months or even years. And we all know how
    often flights have issues with being on time. Therefore, Etherisc brings a clear
    and compelling value proposition to customers, who generally aren't treated fairly
    by airlines and traditional insurance companies alike. This new solution is powered
    by Ethereum.

    angle, perhaps involving the use of money on the platform, but that also have
    a substantial non-monetary component. They can be used in gaming, betting, prediction
    markets, and any decentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces for products or services.
    One such application based on Ethereum is Fun Fair. It provides turnkey online
    casino technology that can be used as a white label solution by anyone, anywhere

    data storage, computing, web hosting, electricity trading, and media and content
    distribution platforms. Pretty much any type of resource and market you can think
    of can benefit from a peer-to-peer sharing economy.

    that need to run large amounts of computation, while providers of such resources
    can be rewarded. All transactions are automated with smart contracts and benefit
    from direct and decentralized peer-to-peer interaction, thus maximizing the value
    for users. All this economic activity benefits from the security and programmability

    peer-to-peer web-hosting platform based on Ethereum. This platform tackles the
    important global problems of cybersecurity and net neutrality. Net neutrality

    by **internet service providers** (**ISP**). Here again, providers of spare computer
    resources for web hosting get rewarded via transactions on the blockchain.

    This project introduces an innovative concept for the advertising industry with
    its decentralized advertising marketplace. It proposes a superior economic model
    for all parties involved – advertisers, publishers, *and* consumers. The project
    is led by Brendan Eich, the creator of the JavaScript programming language and
    co-founder of Mozilla Firefox, the popular web browser. This solution uses smart
    contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to tokenize and trade consumer attention
    to online ads, just like any other commodity. The BAT platform uses its native
    tokens and smart contracts to distribute value across the advertising ecosystem.
    The Brave browser is an integral part of this system – it blocks third-party ads
    and trackers, and measures user attention to online content using embedded and
    transparent machine learning algorithms. User profiles are protected by anonymity
    protocols and features but still provide useful data for targeted ads on the platform.
    Users get rewarded for their attention with native tokens; in other words, they
    get paid to view ads. This is a completely disruptive concept as, so far, there
    hasn''t been a reward mechanism for consumers to monetize their attention to ads.
    There are no middlemen on the platform, such as data brokers, which typically
    collect personal information, aggregate it, build consumer profiles, and sell
    this to advertisers, thereby monetizing people''s personal data. Cutting out such
    middlemen creates efficiencies and value for consumers, publishers, and advertisers
    alike. BAT''s smart contracts automatically distribute the flow of value in the
    ecosystem as follows: advertisers send payments in native tokens along with ads
    to users, as users view ads, the smart contracts unlock the funds and send payments
    to the users, the Brave platform, and the publishers. Therefore, these are multiparty
    transactions facilitated by smart contracts. The marketplace benefits from Ethereum
    blockchain''s decentralization, security, and programmability features.'

    services, but still benefit from the blockchain architecture and smart contracts.
    Despite these applications being non-financial, services on their platforms still
    would have a cost to them that needs to be covered, usually in their native tokens.
    This category includes applications for supply-chain management, such as tracking
    components across the industry supply chain, reputation systems, digital IDs,
    voting, and decentralized governance.

    management that aims to solve the problem of counterfeit consumer goods. Product-authenticity
    verification is done by consumers themselves who scan special RFID labels on the
    products with their smartphones. **RFID** stands for **radio-frequency identification**.
    These labels are applied on the products at a designated point of origin along
    the supply chain and are linked to a unique digital ID for each product. With
    each scan of the RFID tag, the product ID is checked and verified. For each scan,
    users are rewarded WaBi tokens, which currently run on the Ethereum blockchain.
    With the reward transactions, the product ID verification is time- and geo-stamped
    on the blockchain. WaBi tokens serve as both an incentive mechanism in the form
    of reward points, and as a currency to purchase products secured by the system.
    WaBi has been rebranded as Tael. The following diagram shows how WaBi works:'

    on its blockchain. This is done with the help of standardized Ethereum smart contracts,
    such as ERC20\. In this way, people, businesses, or governments can issue their
    own virtual currencies, assets, or application tokens using the Ethereum blockchain,
    without the need to build their own blockchains.

    a massive wave of new start-up ventures that innovate and fund their projects
    on the Ethereum blockchain. The funding comes in the form of **initial coin offerings** (**ICOs**),
    also known as token-generation events. In this way, start-ups can issue digital
    tokens that can be exchanged for services on their future platforms. They can
    also issue tokens that represent financial instruments, such as equity shares.
    These two broad classes of tokens are commonly referred to as utility and security
    tokens. This mechanism turned out to be a huge enabler of crowdfunding on the
    blockchain. It even exceeded traditional early stage venture capital multiple
    times, one of the typical ways that start-ups raise funding. This can be seen

    issue, retain flexibility afterward to use the Ethereum blockchain for their future
    service offering, or to build their own blockchain. This is a business decision
    that needs to be taken on a case-by-case basis.

    for industry-specific reasons or due to scalability issues. The Ethereum blockchain
    currently doesn't have unlimited capacity to handle all applications and their
    transactions at the scale needed for mass adoption. Ethereum is still an early-stage
    and experimental technology. Thus, further progress is needed to upgrade it to
    a point where its network will be robust enough to handle all the traffic of a
    large, decentralized application's ecosystem.

    platform for decentralized applications and ICOs. For instance, NEO, which many
    people call the Ethereum of China, is another such platform. Even Bitcoin has
    a smart contracts functionality that can be used for this, as we saw earlier when
    we discussed the colored coins and **Counterparty** projects.

    decentralized on the blockchain, and it rents out the spare disk space of its
    network nodes rather than a centralized server.

    Civic is a decentralized application for personal-identity verification. They
    launched their ICO by issuing a token on Ethereum, but are moving their platform
    to the Bitcoin blockchain with the help of Rootstock. **Rootstock** (**RSK**)
    is a new platform for decentralized applications that run on top of the Bitcoin
    blockchain. It aims to combine Ethereum-type smart contracts with the security
    of the Bitcoin blockchain, which is second to none.

    to mobile applications. Projects can pick their platform of choice for their decentralized
    application in the same way they can develop mobile apps for Android or Apple
    phones. Android and iOS are two separate platforms with their own protocols and
    app stores. Any mobile application can be built for either platform, and the user
    interface may look the same, but the application code in each case would be different.

    the community and some experts voiced their concerns. Despite the warnings, the
    project went on, and soon after the launch, it got hacked. Around one third of
    the ether raised was diverted to an account controlled by hackers. To resolve
    the situation, the core Ethereum developer team had to make an upgrade in the
    Ethereum software, known as a hard fork, which caused the split of the network
    between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. That's why there are two Ethereum networks
    currently, each with its own native cryptoassets and ecosystem. They share the
    same technological fundamentals, at least as of the time of the hard fork. Then
    one part of the Ethereum community supported the reversal of the DAO hack, while
    the other part did not, insisting on preserving the immutable nature of the blockchain
    above all. The majority of the community supported the hard fork, given the importance
    and consequences of the hack, and thus Ethereum ended up being the main chain.
