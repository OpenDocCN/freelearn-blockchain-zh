- en: Ethereum is one of the most commonly used platforms for building blockchain
    applications. It's a decentralized platform for applications that can run exactly
    as programmed without being affected by fraud, censorship, or third-party interference.

- en: This book will give you a deep understanding of how blockchains work so that
    you can discover the entire ecosystem, core components, and implementations. You
    will get started by learning how to configure and work with various Ethereum protocols
    for developing dApps. Next, you will learn how to code and create powerful smart
    contracts that scale with Solidity and Vyper. You will then explore the building
    blocks of dApps architecture and gain insights into creating your own dApp through
    a variety of real-world examples. The book will even explain how to deploy your
    apps on multiple Ethereum instances with the required best practices and techniques.
    The next few chapters will delve into advanced topics such as building advanced
    smart contracts and multi-page frontends using Ethereum. You will also learn how
    to implement machine learning techniques to build decentralized autonomous applications,
    in addition to several use cases across a variety of domains such as social media
    and e-commerce.

    covers basic blockchain knowledge, which is essential before starting to make
    sure we understand the requirements that will be used across the book. We will
    cover the history of Ethereum from the beginning and end up in more complicated
    topics regarding development.'

    shows us the infrastructure and setup of a blockchain. We will conduct a deeper
    analysis on how blockchains work so that we understand the entire ecosystem. We
    will also learn about the Ethereum components and their various implementations.'

    shows us how to configure and work with various implementations of the Ethereum
    protocol before developing applications in it. There are several flavors, which
    can be used interchangeably for development, testing, and deployment. Later, we
    will look at the Modified Ghost implementation, computation, and Turing completeness
    to understand the Ethereum workflow better. It is also important to understand
    and use the tools and services in the Ethereum ecosystem.'

    teaches us advanced smart contracts that go beyond normal use cases. It is useful
    because it will help us understand advanced techniques, methods, and tools to
    improve our Solidity and Vyper coding skills in order to create powerful smart
    contracts that scale.'

    introduces you to the decentralized app (dApp) architecture and its building blocks.
    Then we will create one dApp step by step from scratch, from a blank application
    to writing smart contracts, creating crypto wallets, and unit testing them. We
    will show you how to create specialized UIs for these apps. We will also show
    you how to use other testing services, such as Truffle, to build seamless dApps.
    We will then show you how to deploy your apps on multiple Ethereum instances,
    such as testrpc, private chain, test chain, and main net.'
