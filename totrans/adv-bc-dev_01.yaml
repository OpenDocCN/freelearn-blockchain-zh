    Around that time the primary usage of blockchain was cryptocurrencies, and many
    new coins emerged during that time. The following graph shows a broad-spectrum
    outline of year wise progression and adaption trend of blockchain technology.
    Years shown on the *x* axis indicate the range of time in which a specific phase
    of blockchain technology falls. Each phase has a name which represents the action
    and is shown on the *x* axis starting from the period of **IDEAS & THOUGHTS**
    to eventually **MATURITY & FURTHER STANDARDIZATION**. The *y* axis shows level
    of activity, involvement and adoption of blockchain technology. The graph shows

    become mature with a high number of users.

    a misleading message. Therefore, there is a need for a viable mechanism that allows
    for agreement among the generals, even in the presence of the treacherous ones,
    so that the attack can still take place at the same time. As an analogy to distributed

    consensus, there are various consensus facilitation algorithms which ensure that

    peers can exchange value / electronic cash using transactions without the need
    for a centrally-trusted arbitrator. For example, for cash transfers, banks act
    as a trusted third party. In financial trading, a central clearing house acts
    as an arbitrator between two trading parties. This concept is compelling, and
    once you absorb it, you will realize the enormous potential of blockchain technology.
    This disintermediation allows blockchain to be a decentralized consensus mechanism
    where no single authority is in charge of the database. Immediately, you'll see
    a significant benefit of decentralization here, because if no banks or central
    clearing houses are required, then it immediately leads to cost savings, faster
    transaction speeds, and trust.

    to denote senders and recipients. An address is usually a public key or derived
    from a public key. While addresses can be reused by the same user, addresses themselves
    are unique. In practice, however, a single user may not use the same address again
    and generate a new one for each transaction. This newly-created address will be
    unique. Bitcoin is, in fact, a pseudonymous system. End users are usually not
    directly identifiable, but some research in removing the anonymity of Bitcoin
    users has shown that they can be identified successfully. A good practice is for
    users to generate a new address for each transaction in order to avoid linking
    transactions to the common owner, thus preventing identification.'

    address to another. Script is a limited language, however, in the sense that it

    that only supports standard preprogrammed arithmetic operations. As such, Bitcoin
    script language cannot be called *Turing complete*. In simple words, Turing complete
    language means that it can perform any computation. It is named after Alan Turing
    who developed the idea of Turing machine that can run any algorithm however complex.

    to describe blockchain in finance industry. Sometimes, blockchain and DLT are
    used interchangeably. Though this is not entirely accurate, it is how the term

    very active and thriving area of research in the financial sector. From a financial
    sector point of view, DLTs are permissioned blockchains that are shared and used
    between known participants. DLTs usually serve as a shared database, with all
    participants known and verified. They do not have a cryptocurrency or do not require
    mining to secure the ledger.

    consistency is achieved as a result of validation from multiple nodes over time.
