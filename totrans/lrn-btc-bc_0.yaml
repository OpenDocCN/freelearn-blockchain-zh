    the various situations in which we can use decentralization and blockchain for
    the benefit of society and individuals. Since this technology is completely new
    and undergoing changes, we hope to see a better world tomorrow that includes security
    and transparency while eliminating all the downsides of the technology. Towards
    the end of the fundamentals of decentralization, we will see how decentralization
    is going to impact the present and future world in a better way.

    concepts used in blockchain and various consensus protocols used in various blockchain
    implementations. We will look at some of the key challenges in privacy on blockchains
    and how solutions such as ZKP can help safeguard privacy. Then we will discuss
    smart contracts, which is one of the core building blocks of blockchain: how they
    are written, what they are, and how they are executed.'

    to the fundamentals of cryptography, and it is using cryptocurrency. We will look
    into the history of Bitcoin, the structure of a blockchain, and the various types
    of blockchain. We will get familiar with the decentralization that sits at the
    core of blockchain. We will get insight on how decentralization works, its pros
    and cons, what all can be decentralized, and how it is impacting the world today.
    We will also get a deeper understanding of the advanced concepts of blockchain,
    such as its structure, architecture, and the protocols used. Finally, this chapter
    will enable us to understand the features and safety provided by the various crypto
    wallets. We will look at how hardware wallets work, some types of physical coin,
    the chances of survival of the various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Altcoin,
    and we will try to understand how to balance and diversify risks related to investing
    in crypto tokens.
