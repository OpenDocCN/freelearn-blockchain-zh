- en: The financial realm was hit in 2017 by two major phenomena caused by cryptocurrencies
    and blockchain. The first one was a bubble that Bitcoin and other digital currencies
    such as Ether and Ripple witnessed from June to December, the latter actually
    gaining a 450-fold increase in value in less than eight months. High volatility
    triggered terrible consequences on cryptocurrencies' credibility of being strong
    financial instruments and real digital assets. This led most financial analysts,
    banks, and hedge funds to consider them as sole speculative and significantly
    risky investments supported by intangible value and unreasonable behaviors from
    the crowd. Stuck into a vicious circle, the mass media started to headline cryptocurrencies
    and blockchain, amplifying the phenomenon and dazzling investors with high returns
    on this new financial product which, inevitably, led to a sharp downfall from
    Christmas 2017 to mid-2018.

- en: The second phenomenon, which was much less covered by the mass media, can actually
    be explained as the catalyst for the first phenomenon. That is, **initial coin
    offerings** (**ICOs**) have been around since 2013, but it was only in 2017 that
    they started to gain consideration. As being a new fundraising method rewarding
    backers with a newly created cryptocurrency, ICOs enable any project to be crowdfunded
    in a matter of minutes. Only eight projects were financed through ICOs in the
    first quarter of 2017 for a total amount of $14 million. But then the fervor started.
    Over the next three months, 30 projects were successfully closed, reaching a total
    amount of almost $1 billion. By the end of the year, more than $5.4 billion was
    raised through ICOs, with 875 ventures launched. It was now the time for investors
    to pick the right project that would become the next Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Ripple.
    During this frenetic period (which eventually paced down in the second semester
    of 2018), the ecosystem looked like a giant casino where, fostered by an irrational
    environment, investors were eager to win big and project leaders to raise quick
    before the bustle slackened.

    to explain with the benefit of hindsight what they and the other derived fundraising
    methods (**security token offering** (**STO**), **equity token offering **(**ETO**),
    and **initial token offering** (**ITO**)) are. We will illustrate their utilization
    through examples, describe what type of tokens can be sold, and explain what advantages
    they bring in terms of fundraising. We will also find out why these methods have
    shown great success while lifting regulatory constraints and ethical questions.

    it is a fundraising tool that trades a new cryptocurrency in exchange for an already
    existing currency. Instead of listing a share on a designated stock exchange like
    in an IPO, the company issues newly created coins that they put up for sale at
    a given price.

    currencies ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp)))
    against a new cryptocoin created specifically for a project. These new coins are
    called tokens and are basically blockchain-based digital coupons that are tradable
    from peer to peer in an irreversible way. By purchasing these digital coupons,
    investors believe in the project's success and the added value coming with their
    resale.

    blockchain-based tokens that they sell over a certain period of time in order
    to raise liquid money that will help them finance their project. Their underlying
    argument is that these tokens will gain value in time and are exchangeable against
    another cryptocurrency.

- en: To understand an ICO, it is sometimes interesting to draw parallels with IPOs.
    Investors in an IPO automatically receive certain rights attached to the shares
    they acquire (dividend, vote, ownership, and so on) that partly contribute to
    the share's intrinsic value. In an ICO, the tokens issued and sold to the investors
    only come along with the promise of the project's success. No right to dividend
    nor right to vote is assigned to the tokens purchased during the ICO. It is a
    major downside that is often brandished as a counter argument by its detractors.
  prefs: []

- en: Moreover, regarding the newness of this financing method, ICOs are mainly unregulated
    in some jurisdictions. A lot of projects have failed these last few years and
    a lot of scams have been identified. Also, most of the project leaders raise money
    before even having developed the product. Thus, it is a highly risky investment.
    For a venture capitalist, it is comparable to investing millions in a seed-stage
    start-up. A thorough upstream research is required before investing in such projects.

    Actually, in 2017, ICO financing has exceeded venture capital fundraising and
    has become the number-one method to finance blockchain start-ups ([https://www.cbinsights.com/research/blockchain-vc-ico-funding/](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/blockchain-vc-ico-funding/)).

    3](b58a1e54-07e5-4b7a-8202-b5a7064ce976.xhtml), *Ethereum* *and Smart Contracts*).
    The founder, Vitalik Buterin, and his team issued between July 22, 2014, and September
    2, 2014, about 60 million Ether (the new cryptocoin or token) in exchange for
    31,500 Bitcoin, equivalent at the time to $18.4 million.

    was launched on July 30, 2015\. The founders motivated the investors that this
    platform would allow people to build decentralized applications upon it. Investors
    were seduced and paid in Bitcoin in exchange for Ether, the currency that would
    later be used as the *fuel* for building applications through the platform. Back
    then, with 1 Bitcoin, you could purchase about 1,900 Ether, which as of June 19,
    2019, is valued at $509,200\. Well worth the investment!

    fundraising and enabled people to do the same. Indeed, having a platform like
    Ethereum allowing developers to build an application without building a blockchain
    from scratch, a lot of projects have seen the light through the platform. One
    could create an application and sell the tokens for further development against
    Ether or Bitcoin. Since the launch of the Ethereum platform, the rise of ICOs
    has been exponential.

    the **decentralized autonomous organization** (**DAO**), whose ICO was launched
    in May 2016\. The aim of this application built on the Ethereum blockchain was
    to create a decentralized venture capital fund with a voting system ruled by DAO
    token holders.

    totally new way of governing an organization seduced around 11,000 investors,
    who financed the project with upto $150 million worth of Ether. Unfortunately,
    on June 17, 2016, a malicious group of hackers managed to exploit a breach within
    the DAO's code and seized control of $3.6 million Ether out of the $11.5 million
    Ether collected by the DAO.

    (**US SEC**), which regulates security tokens in the same way as shares of a company.
    If a project is declared to issue security tokens, the company has to comply with
    US SEC regulations, especially the Securities Act of 1933, in which several obligations
    and requirements have to be fulfilled to be able to raise funds from accredited,
    professional, or individual investors. To determine whether the token is a utility
    token or a security token, the US SEC uses an audit called the **Howey test**.
    It was created by the Supreme Court upon jurisprudence of a real case that happened
    to the Howey Company in 1946\. The test is based on few criteria to determine
    whether a transaction represents an investment contract. In other words, if a
    transaction generates profit for the investors based on the effort of the company
    or project they invested in, then the transaction should be considered an investment
    contract and should abide by US SEC regulations.

    fraudulent manipulations regarding investment contracts, especially when it is
    new of a kind. The US SEC and equivalent institutions in other countries have
    focused their attention on ICOs, mostly because the legal frame is still mainly
    undefined. As it takes many legal resources and a consequent amount of money to
    comply with US SEC requirements, lots of ICO projects have been selling their
    tokens as a utility or digital coupon, or at least tried to turn their token into
    a digital good that does not have to follow the regulation process mandated for
    security tokens.

    tokens. They tend to regulate them as a sale of shares, thus as financial securities.
    The unprecedented DAO attack and the ensuing wide media coverage encouraged regulators
    to take a deeper look in terms of regulatory control. In the future, it is most
    likely that ICOs will be regulated, whether tokens will be considered utilities
    or securities (more on that in [Chapter 6](44366d14-136a-43a6-9fe4-f398092c7f79.xhtml),

    method has been born that intends to benefit from both traditional IPO robustness
    and adherence with financial regulations such as those of the SEC in the US (the US
    SEC's equivalent institutions are the BaFin in Germany, the FINMA in Switzerland,
    and the AMF in France). This customized method is called STO and is technologically
    organized in the same way as an ICO (an issuance of tokens upon a distributed

    financial security, such as equity, debt, or derivative. The process of digitizing
    physical assets through blockchain-based tokens is called **tokenization**. Because
    companies operating an STO basically sell tokens representing a tradable financial
    asset, they have to comply even more rigorously than ICOs with financial institutions
    and requirements from regulatory bodies.

    securities, which can be subsided in different categories called ETOs or ITOs.
