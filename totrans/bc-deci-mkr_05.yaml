- en: The financial realm was hit in 2017 by two major phenomena caused by cryptocurrencies
    and blockchain. The first one was a bubble that Bitcoin and other digital currencies
    such as Ether and Ripple witnessed from June to December, the latter actually
    gaining a 450-fold increase in value in less than eight months. High volatility
    triggered terrible consequences on cryptocurrencies' credibility of being strong
    financial instruments and real digital assets. This led most financial analysts,
    banks, and hedge funds to consider them as sole speculative and significantly
    risky investments supported by intangible value and unreasonable behaviors from
    the crowd. Stuck into a vicious circle, the mass media started to headline cryptocurrencies
    and blockchain, amplifying the phenomenon and dazzling investors with high returns
    on this new financial product which, inevitably, led to a sharp downfall from
    Christmas 2017 to mid-2018.

  zh: 2017年，金融领域受到了两个由加密货币和区块链引起的重大现象的冲击。第一个是比特币和其他数字货币（如以太坊和瑞波）从6月到12月间经历的泡沫，后者实际上在不到八个月的时间里价值增长了450倍。高波动性对加密货币作为强大金融工具和真正数字资产的信誉造成了可怕的影响。这导致大多数金融分析师、银行和对冲基金将它们视为单一的投机性和风险极高的投资，支持者仅靠无形价值和群体的不合理行为。陷入恶性循环中，大众媒体开始报道加密货币和区块链，放大这一现象，并以高回报率引诱投资者投资这种新的金融产品，这不可避免地导致了从2017年圣诞节到2018年年中的急剧下降。
- en: The second phenomenon, which was much less covered by the mass media, can actually
    be explained as the catalyst for the first phenomenon. That is, **initial coin
    offerings** (**ICOs**) have been around since 2013, but it was only in 2017 that
    they started to gain consideration. As being a new fundraising method rewarding
    backers with a newly created cryptocurrency, ICOs enable any project to be crowdfunded
    in a matter of minutes. Only eight projects were financed through ICOs in the
    first quarter of 2017 for a total amount of $14 million. But then the fervor started.
    Over the next three months, 30 projects were successfully closed, reaching a total
    amount of almost $1 billion. By the end of the year, more than $5.4 billion was
    raised through ICOs, with 875 ventures launched. It was now the time for investors
    to pick the right project that would become the next Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Ripple.
    During this frenetic period (which eventually paced down in the second semester
    of 2018), the ecosystem looked like a giant casino where, fostered by an irrational
    environment, investors were eager to win big and project leaders to raise quick
    before the bustle slackened.

  zh: 第二个现象，被大众媒体覆盖得少得多，实际上可以解释为第一个现象的催化剂。也就是说，**首次代币发行**（**ICO**）自2013年以来就存在，但直到2017年才开始受到重视。作为一种新的筹款方法，将支持者用新创建的加密货币奖励，ICO能够在几分钟内使任何项目成为众筹项目。2017年第一季度，仅有8个项目通过ICO筹资，总额为1400万美元。但随后热潮开始了。在接下来的三个月里，30个项目成功关闭，总金额接近10亿美元。到年底，通过ICO筹集了超过54亿美元，共推出了875个项目。现在是投资者选择下一个比特币、以太坊或瑞波的正确项目的时候了。在这个狂热的时期（最终在2018年下半年趋缓），生态系统看起来像一个巨大的赌场，在一个不理性的环境中，投资者渴望赢得大奖，而项目领导人则渴望在繁忙减缓之前快速筹款。
- en: Now that the ecosystem has become more consistent with ICOs, we will be able
    to explain with the benefit of hindsight what they and the other derived fundraising
    methods (**security token offering** (**STO**), **equity token offering **(**ETO**),
    and **initial token offering** (**ITO**)) are. We will illustrate their utilization
    through examples, describe what type of tokens can be sold, and explain what advantages
    they bring in terms of fundraising. We will also find out why these methods have
    shown great success while lifting regulatory constraints and ethical questions.

- en: An ICO is somewhat like an **initial public offering** (**IPO**). Basically,
    it is a fundraising tool that trades a new cryptocurrency in exchange for an already
    existing currency. Instead of listing a share on a designated stock exchange like
    in an IPO, the company issues newly created coins that they put up for sale at
    a given price.

- en: Put simply, it is a project funded by liquid money (Bitcoin, Ethereum, or fiat
    currencies ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp)))
    against a new cryptocoin created specifically for a project. These new coins are
    called tokens and are basically blockchain-based digital coupons that are tradable
    from peer to peer in an irreversible way. By purchasing these digital coupons,
    investors believe in the project's success and the added value coming with their

- en: To understand an ICO, it is sometimes interesting to draw parallels with IPOs.
    Investors in an IPO automatically receive certain rights attached to the shares
    they acquire (dividend, vote, ownership, and so on) that partly contribute to
    the share's intrinsic value. In an ICO, the tokens issued and sold to the investors
    only come along with the promise of the project's success. No right to dividend
    nor right to vote is assigned to the tokens purchased during the ICO. It is a
    major downside that is often brandished as a counter argument by its detractors.

  zh: 要理解ICO，有时将其与IPO进行类比是很有趣的。在IPO中，投资者自动获得其所获股份附带的某些权利（红利，投票权，所有权等），这在一定程度上促成了股份的内在价值。在ICO中，发行并出售给投资者的代币只是伴随着项目成功的承诺。购买ICO期间的代币没有分红权或投票权。这是一个经常被其批评者作为反驳论据的主要缺点。
- en: Moreover, regarding the newness of this financing method, ICOs are mainly unregulated
    in some jurisdictions. A lot of projects have failed these last few years and
    a lot of scams have been identified. Also, most of the project leaders raise money
    before even having developed the product. Thus, it is a highly risky investment.
    For a venture capitalist, it is comparable to investing millions in a seed-stage
    start-up. A thorough upstream research is required before investing in such projects.

  zh: 此外，关于这种融资方式的新颖性，在一些司法管辖区主要是没有受到监管的。在过去的几年中有很多项目失败，也有很多诈骗被识别出来。此外，大多数项目领导者在甚至开发产品之前就筹集资金。因此，这是一种高风险的投资。对于风险投资家，这相当于在种子期初期创业公司投入数百万美元。在投资此类项目之前需要进行彻底的上游研究。

- en: The distinction between the two comes from the **US Security and Exchange Commission**
    (**US SEC**), which regulates security tokens in the same way as shares of a company.
    If a project is declared to issue security tokens, the company has to comply with
    US SEC regulations, especially the Securities Act of 1933, in which several obligations
    and requirements have to be fulfilled to be able to raise funds from accredited,
    professional, or individual investors. To determine whether the token is a utility
    token or a security token, the US SEC uses an audit called the **Howey test**.
    It was created by the Supreme Court upon jurisprudence of a real case that happened
    to the Howey Company in 1946\. The test is based on few criteria to determine
    whether a transaction represents an investment contract. In other words, if a
    transaction generates profit for the investors based on the effort of the company
    or project they invested in, then the transaction should be considered an investment
    contract and should abide by US SEC regulations.

  zh: ICO 有何革命性之处？
- en: ICOs are a true innovation in the traditional venture-funding model. Usually,
    a project could take months to be financed by investment funds and needs to have
    already been financed by angel investors, to have conducted strong marketing research,
    and have shown a real usefulness and need from customers.

  zh: ICO 在传统风险投资模式中是真正的创新。通常，一个项目可能需要几个月的时间才能被投资基金融资，并且需要已经由天使投资者融资过，已经进行了强大的市场研究，并且已经从客户那里展示出了真正的用途和需求。
- en: Today, for an ICO to take off, all it takes is to write a nice description of
    a project through a so-called white paper, design a beautiful website, and showcase
    some drawings or pictures of the product. As simplistic as it sounds, some projects
    and pre-product start-ups actually raised a significant amount of money without
    any prototype or demonstration.

  zh: 如今，要让一个ICO成功起步，只需要通过所谓的白皮书对项目进行精美的描述，设计一个美丽的网站，并展示产品的一些绘画或图片。虽然听起来很简单，但一些项目和早期的初创企业实际上在没有任何原型或演示的情况下筹集了大量资金。
- en: 'Many ICOs are launched every month, reaching new sky-high records in terms
    of funds raised. According to ICObench.com, a rating and listing website for ICOs,

  zh: 总结
- en: In conclusion, ICOs are innovative ways to finance a project. They shift the
    crowdfunding method as we know it today into a decentralized and transparent way
    of raising money through an unlimited number of investors. Throughout the chapter,
    we established how effective it is for project leaders seeking leverage to advance
    the development of their blockchain-based application.

  zh: 总之，ICO是为了融资项目而创新的途径。它们将今天我们所知道的众筹方式转变为通过无限数量的投资者进行透明化的去中心化筹集资金的有效方式。在本章中，我们确定了对于寻求杠杆作用推进其基于区块链的应用程序发展的项目负责人而言，它是多么有效。
- en: We showed how Ethereum enabled many dApps to be developed and tokens to be issued
    through their platform, increasing the democratization of ICOs. Also, we mentioned
    the story of the DAO, a groundbreaking practice to run an investment fund between
    individuals in a decentralized manner, which unfortunately suffered a massive
    hack during its ICO and attracted the attention of the US SEC and other financial
    authorities.

  zh: 我们展示了以太坊如何使许多dApps通过他们的平台进行开发，并通过他们的平台发行代币，增加了ICO的民主化。另外，我们提到了DAO的故事，这是一种在去中心化的方式在个人之间运行投资基金的突破性实践，不幸的是，在其ICO期间遭受了大规模的黑客攻击，并引起了美国证监会和其他金融当局的关注。
- en: To this extent, we will touch upon an economic and social overview of blockchain
    in the next chapter. This will help us embrace a larger spectrum and avoid the
    common misconceptions and clichés that the latest effervescence has strengthened.
    We will then find out how global regulatory bodies are behaving and what actions
    public institutions have taken to keep up with the technological advancements
    brought by blockchain.
