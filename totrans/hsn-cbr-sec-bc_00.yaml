- en: Blockchain technology is being hailed as one of the most revolutionary and disruptive
    innovations of today. Blockchain technology was first identified in the world's
    most popular digital currency, Bitcoin, but now has changed the perception of
    several organizations and empowered them to use it even for storage and transfer
    of value.

- en: This book will start by introducing you to the common cyber threat landscape
    and common attacks, such as malware, phishing, insider threat, and DDoS. The next
    set of chapters will help you understand the workings of blockchain technology,
    Ethereum, and Hyperledger architecture, and how they fit into the cybersecurity
    ecosystem. These chapters will also help you write your first distributed application
    on Ethereum blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric framework. Later, you will learn
    about the security triad and its adaptation with Blockchain. The last set of chapters
    will take you through the core concepts of cybersecurity, such as DDoS protection,
    PKI-based identity, 2FA, and DNS security. You will learn how blockchain plays
    a crucial role in transforming cybersecurity solutions fundamentally.
