    a wallet service are security and trust. Users must feel that their funds are
    secure and the administrator of the wallet service doesn't steal their funds.
    The wallet service we will build in this chapter will tackle both these issues.

    address and its associated private key.

- en: A wallet is said to be an online wallet when it is connected to the Internet.
    For example, wallets stored in geth, any website/database, and so on are called
    online wallets. Online wallets are also called hot wallets, web wallets, hosted
    wallets, and so on. Online wallets are not recommended at least when storing large
    amounts of ether or storing ether for a long time because they are risky. Also,
    depending on where the wallet is stored, it may require trusting a third party.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, most of the popular wallet services store the private keys of the
    wallets with themselves and allow you to access the wallet via an e-mail and password,
    so basically, you don't have actual access to the wallet, and if they want, they
    can steal the funds in the wallets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A wallet is said to be an offline wallet when it is not connected to the Internet.
    For example, wallets stored in pen drives, papers, text files, and so on. Offline
    wallets are also called cold wallets. Offline wallets are more secure than online
    wallets because to steal funds, someone will need physical access to the storage.
    The challenges with offline storage is that you need to find a location that you
    won't delete accidentally or forget, or nobody else can have access to. Many people
    store the wallet in paper and keep the paper in a safe locker if they want to
    hold some funds safely for a very long time. If you want to frequently send funds
    from your account, then you can store it in a password-protected pen drive and
    also in a safe locker. It is a little risker to store wallets in a digital device
    only because digital devices can corrupt anytime and you may lose access to your
    wallet; that's why along with storing in a pen drive, you should also put it in
    a safe locker. You can also find a better solution depending on your needs, but
    just make sure it's safe and that you accidentally don't lose access to it.

    we saw were using the `from` address that's present in the Ethereum node; therefore,
    the Ethereum node was able to sign the transactions before broadcasting. But if
    you have the private key of a wallet stored somewhere else, then geth cannot find
    it. Therefore, in this case, you will need to use the `web3.eth.sendRawTransaction()`
    method to broadcast transactions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`web3.eth.sendRawTransaction()` is used to broadcast raw transactions, that
    is, you will have to write code to create and sign raw transactions. The Ethereum
    node will directly broadcast it without doing anything else to the transaction.
    But writing code to broadcast transactions using `web3.eth.sendRawTransaction()`
    is difficult because it requires generating the data part, creating raw transactions,
    and also signing the transactions.'

- en: The Hooked-Web3-Provider library provides us with a custom provider, which communicates
    with geth using HTTP; but the uniqueness of this provider is that it lets us sign
    the `sendTransaction()` calls of contract instances using our keys. Therefore,
    we don't need to create data part of the transactions anymore. The custom provider
    actually overrides the implementation of the `web3.eth.sendTransaction()` method.
    So basically, it lets us sign both the `sendTransaction()` calls of contract instances
    and also the `web3.eth.sendTransaction()` calls. The `sendTransaction()` method
    of contract instances internally generate data of the transaction and callsÂ `web3.eth.sendTransaction()`
    to broadcast the transaction.

    Hooked-Web3-Provider library. This constructor takes an object that has two properties,
    which must be provided. `host` is the HTTP URL of the node and `transaction_signer`
    is an object that the custom provider communicates with to get the transaction
    signed.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    `hasAddress` is invoked to check whether the transaction can be signed, that is,
    to check whether the transaction signer has the private key of the `from` address
    account. This method receives the address and a callback. The callback should
    be called with the first argument as an error message and the second argument
    as `false` if the private key of the address is not found. And if the private
    key is found, the first argument should be `null`, and the second argument should
    be `true`.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the private key for the address is found, then the custom provider invokes
    the `signTransaction` method to get the transaction signed. This method has two
    parameters, that is, the transactions parameters and a callback. Inside the method,
    at first, we convert the transaction parameters to raw transaction parameters,
    that is, the raw transaction parameters values are encoded as hexadecimal strings.
    Then we create a buffer to hold the private key. The buffer is created using the
    `EthJS.Util.toBuffer()` method, which is part of the `ethereumjs-util` library.
    The `ethereumjs-util` library is imported by the `ethereumjs-tx` library. We then
    create a raw transaction and sign it, after which we serialize and convert it
    to hexadecimal strings. Finally, we need to provide the hexadecimal string of
    the signed raw transaction to the custom provider using the callback. In case
    there is an error inside the method, then the first argument of the callback should
    be an error message.

    `nonce` because the custom provider can calculate nonce. Earlier, many of these
    were optional because we were leaving it to the Ethereum node to calculate them,
    but now as we are signing it ourselves, we need to provide all of them. The `gas`

    of the signing address. You must be wondering how a miner will verify the authenticity
    of a transaction without the public key. Miners use a unique property of ECDSA,
    which allows you to calculate the public key from the message and signature. In
    a transaction, the message indicates the intention of the transaction, and the
    signature is used to find whether the message is signed using the correct private
    key. This is what makes ECDSA so special. ethereumjs-tx providesÂ an API to verify

    same seed, the same addresses and keys will be generated, and hierarchical indicates
    that the addresses and keys will be generated in the same order. This makes it
    easier to back up and store multiple accounts, as you just have to store the seed,

    `encryption`, and `txutils`. `signing`, `encrpytion,` and `txutils` provide APIs
    to sign transactions, asymmetric cryptography, and create transactions respectively,
    whereas a `keystore` namespace is used to create a `keystore`, generated seed,
    and so on. `keystore` is an object that holds the seed and keys encrypted. The
    `keystore` namespace implements transaction signer methods that requires signing
    the `we3.eth.sendTransaction()` calls if we are using Hooked-Web3-Provider. Therefore
    the `keystore`Â namespace can automatically create and sign transactions for the
    addresses that it can find in it. Actually, LightWallet is primarily intended
    to be a signing provider for the Hooked-Web3-Provider.

    You can create new derivation paths or overwrite the purpose of derivation paths
    present using the `addHdDerivationPath()` method of a `keystore` instance. You
    can also change the default derivation path using the `setDefaultHdDerivationPath()`
    method of a `keystore` instance. Finally, once the `keystore` namespace is created,
    the instance is returned via the callback. So here, we created a `keystore` using
    a password and seed only.'

- en: Now we need to generate the number of addresses and their associated keys the
    user needs. As we can generate millions of addresses from a seed, `keystore` doesn't
    generate any address until we want it to because it doesn't know how many addresses
    we want to generate. After creating the `keystore`, we generate the symmetric
    key from the password using the `keyFromPassword` method. And then we call the
    `generateNewAddress()` method to generate addresses and their associated keys.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`generateNewAddress()` takes three arguments: password derived key, number
    of addresses to generate, and derivation path. As we haven''t provided a derivation
    path, it uses the default derivation path of the keystore. If you call `generateNewAddress()`
    multiple times, it resumes from the address it created in the last call. For example,
    if you call this method twice, each time generating two addresses, you will have
    the first four addresses.'

    Now let's write the implementation of the `send_ether()` method, which is used
    to send ether from one of the addresses generated from the seed.

    After that, we assign a callback to the `passwordProvider` property of `ks`. This
    callback is invoked during transaction signing to get the password to decrypt
    the private key. If we don't provide this, LightWallet prompts the user to enter
    the password. And then, we create a `HookedWeb3Provider` instance by passing the
    `keystore` as the transaction signer. Now when the custom provider wants a transaction
    to be signed, it calls the `hasAddress` and `signTransactions` methods of `ks`.
    If the address to be signed is not among the generated addresses, `ks` will give
    an error to the custom provider. And finally, we send some ether using the `web3.eth.sendTransaction`
    method.
