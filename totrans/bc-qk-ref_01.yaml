    everyone in finance, technology, and other similar industries. Apart from bringing
    a new overview to record keeping and consensus, blockchain has enormous potential
    for disruption in most industries. Early adopters, enthusiasts, and now governments
    and organizations are exploring the uses of blockchain technology.

- en: Another type of money is **commodity money**; it is derived from the commodity
    out of which the good money is made. For example, if a silver coin is made, the
    value of the coin would be its value in terms of silver, rather than the defined
    value of the coin. Commodity money was a convenient form of trade in comparison
    to the barter system. However, it is prone to huge fluctuations in price.

  zh: 另一种货币是**商品货币**；它源自制造好货币所用的商品。例如，如果制作银币，其价值将是以银的价值来衡量，而不是币值的定义价值。与以物易物相比，商品货币是贸易的一种便利形式。然而，它容易出现巨大的价格波动。
- en: Commodity money proved to be difficult to carry around, so, instead, governments
    introduced printed currency, which could be redeemed from the government-based
    banks for actual commodity, but then, even that proved to be difficult for the
    government to manage, and it introduced fiat-based currency, or faith-based currency.

    short, the book in which accounts are maintained is called a **ledger**. It is

    everybody doing a transaction in blockchain has a record of other transactions
    that have happened or are happening in the blockchain-based Bitcoin system. This
    decentralized ledger gives multiple authenticity points for every transaction
    that has happened; plus, the rules are pre-defined and not different for each
