    that making your life and business better. You will cover the architecture, **Initial
    Coin Offerings** (**ICOs**), tokens, smart contracts, and terminology, before
    studying how they work. All you need is a curious mind to get started with blockchain
    technology. Once you have grasped the basics, you will explore components of Ethereum,
    such as ether token, transactions, and smart contracts, in order to build simple
    Dapps. You will then move on to learning why Solidity is used specifically for
    Ethereum-based projects, followed by exploring different types of blockchain with
    easy-to-follow examples. All this will help you tackle challenges and problems.
    In addition to this, you will learn how blockchain has been revolutionizing IoT
    and machine learning, and how it can affect business processes.
