    AI, and the same goes for blockchain. With access to large amounts of user data,
    tech companies are now able to offer in-house AI-driven assistants to their customers.
    Banks and insurance companies are using chatbots to reduce operational costs and
    retain customer engagement. Investment companies and trading apps are using robo-advisors
    to get the latest buying and selling trends of stocks in the share market. Similarly,
    we have seen the introduction of virtual assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Google

    to the AI Landscape*, AI is also software, and as such, it requires rigorous testing
    to ensure software quality. One of the earliest methods of testing AI was proposed
    by Alan Turing. He called it the Turing test.

    text. The evaluator is told that one of the two pieces of text comes from a machine,
    and the other from a human. In the original idea of the Turing test, the interrogation
    would be limited to text only. If the evaluator cannot reliably determine the
    human-generated text and the machine-generated text, the machine is said to have
    successfully evaded the evaluator and has passed the test. It is important to
    note that the test does not focus on AI''s ability to give correct answers to
    questions. The test only focuses on how closely the text resembles what a human
    might produce. I highly recommend that you learn more about the Turing test by
    reading the Wikipedia article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test).'

    products using such AI models are targeting users who are tied to multiple applications,

    to developers, there also exists a need to maintain the transparency of AI's performance.
    This will prevent companies from making audacious claims about the safety and
    quality of their AI algorithms in a context-rich environment. In conclusion, we
    need a comprehensive testing framework that can also maintain the transparency
    of test results. These requirements are fulfilled by the TEXA framework.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TEXA is a novel testing and benchmarking framework backed by simple mathematical
    theory. It can be used to interact with, evaluate, and assess AI that works in
    multi-context environments. In simple terms, TEXA enhances the concept of Turing
    testing by allowing the tester to assign a binary score to each and every interaction
    with the machine. This will allow us to quantify the quality of our models and
    compare their performance in multiple contexts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This testing framework is based on new mathematical models that allow testers
    to provide their feedback on the AI's performance at a granular level. Each interaction
    between the AI and the tester can be scored. The score provided by the tester
    is in binary format, meaning 1 or 0\. These scores are called **quantum scores**.
    Each quantum score represents the satisfaction of the tester with an interaction
    with the AI. The addition of quantum scores in the TEXA framework is a feature
    that can help quantify the experience of the user in a subjective manner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apart from quantum scores, the TEXA framework also provides the opportunity
    to test AI across multiple contexts. Let's assume that a chatbot is built to address
    the requirements of making suitable recommendations to traders dealing with capital
    markets, derivatives, and stocks. This chatbot might be plugged into a data interface
    that can provide insights to three different types of users. All these users require
    critical information without any delay or confusion. Hence, it is important that
    the chatbot does not mistake a stock-related query for a derivatives-related query.
    Under traditional testing circumstances, three separate testing sessions would
    be created to test the implementation. However, we must understand that only one
    chatbot instance will be running in production, supporting three types of users.
    Hence, anomalies are difficult to observe if testing is isolated. To observe anomalies
    during context switching, the TEXA framework allows the tester to create **slabs**.
    Basically, the slab is a parameter that represents the context of an interaction
    between the interrogator and the AI. During the interaction testing session, the
    tester can provide granular targeted feedback by selecting the appropriate slab
    before assigning the quantum score for the AI's response.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The quantum scores assigned to each interaction belonging to a slab are used
    to calculate scores and compare the AI's responsiveness and accuracy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the testing session is complete and the scores are submitted, the test
    scores are computed and stored on the local database. Once stored on the local
    database, the test scores are published on the public **InterPlanetary File System**
    (**IPFS**). Once published, a public link is generated for the tester to check
    the results data. Subsequently, the **Content Identifier** (**CID**) returned
    by the public IPFS network is used to sign a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain's
    Kovan testnet. The transaction link is also generated and returned to the tester.
    The transaction is public data with an audit trail that's accessible to the general
    public and interested enthusiasts. This enables a transparent community for the
    development and testing of AI, with fewer chances of anyone meddling in the process
    of scoring and ranking AIs in the future.
