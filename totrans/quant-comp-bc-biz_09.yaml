    and use cases that I would be focusing on. I had a vision for the flow of the
    book, and the real-world problems I would be covering. However, through the research
    I have done over the course of writing the book, I realized there were areas that
    I should be touching upon that I hadn't planned to. The interview with Max Henderson
    was certainly serendipitous for me as an author, and something I hadn't planned
    for. I hope it will bring to light an interesting application of quantum computing
    for you, the reader.

    classical data through those and extract data by measuring the final state. You

    of the original data.

    anyway. They're trying to extract nonlinear data using classical transformations.
    The idea is to see if we could use quantum circuits of various types, flavors,
    initializations, and ways of encoding. To then decode the information, we use
    quantum nonlinearities to extract useful features from classical data that could
    be used in a broader machine learning context. So that's an exciting and very
    new line of research in the quantum machine learning world that's getting some
    real attention now.

    could be done by a quantum computer. Once the key data points are identified,

    a binary system. Also, the fact that there are correlations between states gave
    birth to the idea of trying to put this on a quantum computer. With quantum computers,
    the strength really is that they are intrinsically correlated systems. You can't
    affect one piece of the system without affecting the rest of it. There was a machine
    learning algorithm called the Boltzmann machine that I had already done a decent

    So, if you have 50 states, there are 2^(50) possible outcomes. If you are doing
    a true forecast, every potential outcome is non-zero, even though some of those
    outcomes have very low probabilities. So at the end of the day, the best forecast
    would have the ability to create accurate probabilities for all measurable outcomes
    and then sum up all those things together to give a true probabilistic forecast.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    bunch of possible outcomes, and no one wants to crunch all those numbers. People
    typically make approximations, or they will ignore the correlations between states,
    because then it's very easy to model individual states and just add up all the
    individual results. We got the idea that maybe we can map this onto a quantum
    system. While the system is in superposition, it is theoretically in all possible
    states at once. By making a finite number of samples, we might get a very good
    approximation of that full distribution of probabilities by taking advantage of
    the fundamental physics driving that system.

    is a very difficult distribution of probabilities to do classically, but we think
    there is a bit of a natural fit for quantum computers. Putting it on a quantum
    computer such as those made by D-Wave was an easy choice for this kind of modeling

    early days for quantum computers, but this is a really good fit for the type of

    the hardware tools to plug into that software framework, quantum application firms
    solving specific industry problems are going to be hard-pressed in that regard.
    You know, we aren't the ones trying to push forward that part of the stack. So,
    we are dependent on the hardware providers ultimately making good quantum hardware
    that we can show has relevance to business applications. So, I think that's sort
    of the challenge for the people at the top of the stack.

    party is not bottlenecked by another. On that note, Max, I think we have come
    to the end of the interview. I would like to thank you again for your time and
    amazing insights.'

    quantum computing. Until I stumbled upon Max's work, I had understood the applications
    of quantum computing in financial services, logistics, healthcare, and other traditionally
    data-rich industries. However, politics is a new industry in this context, and
    it is very data-hungry.

    the quantum computing stack. It is critical to note here that there is innovation
    across the quantum computing tech stack, and each layer of the stack (be it hardware
    or the application) has its own challenges. A slowdown in innovation in one part
    of the stack has a profound impact on innovation throughout the rest of the stack.

    be a hybrid step in the evolution of quantum computing. The hybrid step could
    involve a neo-classical computing method. In *Chapter 5*, *Interview with Dr.
    Dave Snelling, Fujitsu Fellow*, we saw how the digital annealer could be a bridge
    between classical and quantum computing.

    who lead the formation of democratic administrations rely on cutting-edge technology.
    Social media data is a critical component in making this work for all parties
    interested in understanding the voters. I hope that we will see more groundbreaking
    results when Max uses his application in the 2020 American elections.
