    is a technology that pretty much took the world by storm in 2017, and it shows
    no signs of slowing down. Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrency are words that
    almost everybody knows these days. These words have entered peoples' minds through

    records that are linked to each other via cryptography. In simple terms, a blockchain
    is a record of a particular transaction that is encrypted, secured, and linked
    to other transactions.

  zh: 更少中心化的互联网，更多点对点的互动将遏制大型互联网垄断并绕过门户守卫者。去中心化可以赋予消费者和生产者更多的权力，通过让他们对个人数据有更多控制，并在在线业务中提供一个公平竞争的场所。它也可以增加**生产者消费者**的角色，在系统中既消费又生产商品和服务的人。一些例子包括去中心化社交网络和市场，参与者通过贡献内容或同时分享和消耗资源而获得奖励。这是一个由分布式应用所实现的新型共享经济。
- en: Fully-programmable blockchain networks enable such distributed applications
    and peer-to-peer marketplaces. We have recently seen many startups trying to build
    more efficient markets for scarce resources, such as electricity, computer processing
    power, file storage, and advertising. Whether blockchain technology can be applied
    successfully to add value to such projects is a matter of scalability, user interfaces,
    and user experience.

  zh: 完全可编程的区块链网络使这些分布式应用和点对点市场成为可能。最近，我们看到许多初创公司试图构建更有效率的市场，用于稀缺资源，例如电力、计算机处理能力、文件存储和广告。区块链技术是否能成功应用于为这些项目增加价值是一个关于可扩展性、用户界面和用户体验的问题。
- en: Interoperability with other systems (and the internet as a whole) is also very
    important, and there are projects trying to build such protocol infrastructures
    in an efficient way. More importantly, the protocols are the sets of standardized
    rules adopted worldwide for using in computer systems to communicate with each
    other. Protocols, such as HTTP and FTP, have formed the base layer of the internet.
    Such protocols are now being developed for distributed computing systems, such
    as blockchain. The interaction of these new technologies and the concept of a
    shared economy is expected to deliver the vision of web 3.0.

  zh: 与其他系统（以及整个互联网）的互操作性也非常重要，有一些项目正在努力以高效的方式构建这样的协议基础设施。更重要的是，这些协议是全球范围内采用的标准化规则集，用于计算机系统之间的通信。诸如HTTP和FTP之类的协议已经形成了互联网的基础层。现在正在为分布式计算系统（例如区块链）开发这些协议。这些新技术与共享经济理念的相互作用有望实现Web
    3.0的愿景。
