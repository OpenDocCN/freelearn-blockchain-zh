    is a technology that pretty much took the world by storm in 2017, and it shows
    no signs of slowing down. Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrency are words that
    almost everybody knows these days. These words have entered peoples' minds through
    mainstream media, which has finally paid some attention to this exciting new technology.

    records that are linked to each other via cryptography. In simple terms, a blockchain
    is a record of a particular transaction that is encrypted, secured, and linked
    to other transactions.

    was hard not to pay attention to a market that had increased in value by around
    50 times over the course of 12 months, from around 15 billion US dollars in January,
    2017, to over 830 billion US dollars on 7 January, 2018.

    traded cryptoassets (meaning the currencies that are in circulation), and not
    the entire supply! A lot of the supply is still locked away and kept by the founding
    teams, which helps to make Bitcoin as secure as it is now. You will learn more
    about this in later chapters of this book.

    and startups, especially when these markets are public and global, which means
    that anyone, from anywhere in the world, can take part 24/7! That's the main reason

    $60 billion. This catapulted him ahead of people like the founders of Google,
    Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and the founder of Oracle, Larry Ellison. Only Amazon's
    Jeff Bezos, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett,
    and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg were ahead of him at the time.

    it attracted a lot of talent to this space. Thousands of developers and business
    people have joined the industry and focused their efforts on building blockchain
    projects. All of this new energy must lead to substantial results and value creation,
    which will justify some of the hype and market valuations that we have seen. But
    such fundamental developments and value creation don't happen overnight. They
    take a lot of time and effort.

    to use blockchain for pretty much everything; this just shows an attempt to ride
    the hype wave. There were even cases such as the New York-based soft drinks company
    Long Island Iced Tea, which rebranded itself to Long Blockchain Corp, only to
    see its shares rise by nearly 500%. Such actions definitely don't help anyone,
    as the company was promptly investigated by the **Securities and Exchange Commission**

    and this has resulted in the creation of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond,
    Bitcoin Private, and Bitcoin **Satoshi's Vision** (**SV**), among others. Such
    developments may partly result from a desire to improve the protocol, but they
    also result from greedy attempts to achieve more control and extract more value
    from the internet of money. Effective governance of decentralized systems in the
    presence of multiple (and sometimes, contradictory) interests that have to be
    balanced is one of the most difficult problems that need to be solved going forward.

    quick and efficient transaction settlement are definitely right at the top. This
    can enable lots of interesting use cases, from payments and money transfers to
    property registers and capital markets. Such infrastructures can be public or
    private, the main differences being in the level of trust embedded in the system.
    A public network that is open to everyone, where parties don't know each other,
    needs a different level of security and a different consensus mechanism than a
    private, permissioned network, where parties are vetted before they are allowed
    to join. This will be discussed in detail later on.

    2 billion people who are unbanked. That's over a quarter of the entire global
    population! As you can imagine, this stunts global economic progress significantly.
    Not to mention that the unbanked people, who are mostly from developing countries,
    are at a clear disadvantage. It is difficult enough to increase productivity and
    trade within their own country, let alone transacting with the rest of the world.
    Many people consider the fees for sending money overseas for these populations
    unfair. Money transfer services, such as Western Union and MoneyGram, were charging
    10% on average in 2008, and 7.5% in 2016. Blockchain technology can disrupt the

    large internet monopolies and circumvent gatekeepers. Decentralization can empower
    consumers and producers alike, by giving them more control over their personal
    data and a level playing field in online business. It can also increase the role
    of **prosumers,** people that both consume and produce goods and services in a
    system. Some examples include decentralized social networks, and marketplaces,
    where participants are rewarded for contributing content or sharing and consuming
    resources at the same time. This is a next-level sharing economy, enabled by distributed

    other. Protocols, such as HTTP and FTP, have formed the base layer of the internet.
    Such protocols are now being developed for distributed computing systems, such
    as blockchain. The interaction of these new technologies and the concept of a
    shared economy is expected to deliver the vision of web 3.0.
