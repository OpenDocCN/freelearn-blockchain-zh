- en: This Learning Path is your easy reference for exploring and building blockchain
    networks using Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Hyperledger Composer. It begins
    with an overview of blockchain and shows you how to set up an Ethereum development
    environment for developing, packaging, building, and testing campaign-decentralized
    applications. You'll learn Solidity – the de facto language for developing decentralized
    applications in Ethereum. You'll configure the Hyperledger Fabric and use these
    components to build private blockchain networks and applications that connect
    to them. Starting with the principles first, you'll learn to design and launch
    a network, implement smart contracts in chaincode, and much more.

    decentralized applications by handling the key pain points encountered in the
    blockchain life cycle.
