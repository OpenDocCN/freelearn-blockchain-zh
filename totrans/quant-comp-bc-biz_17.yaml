    entrepreneur, she had mentioned that one needs to have a PhD in Physics, Math,

    thesis of the book, I knew I had to stick to my strengths.

    over the past 5 to 6 years. My experience as a VC had taught me two key lessons
    over the years. The first one was that technology was just a means to an end,
    and it is essential to focus on the "*So What?*" The second lesson was that a
    technologist should be able to keep the narrative simple.

    specialist. It often involved working with Managing Directors and C-Suite executives.
    Many of these highly accomplished individuals looked at technology as a silver
    bullet. They felt there was a special technology out there that could solve their
    business model and process inefficiencies. I had to keep stressing to them that
    technology was just a means to an end.

    start-ups. This number would go past 2,000 if we took the last five years into

    That connection can only happen by simplifying the narrative around the technology.

    of technology startups. I still have to make optimistic predictions that they
    will break through their technological, operational, and market barriers. In doing
    so, they would help achieve high returns for my fund and my investors.

    This is because we get early access to innovative companies across industries.
    Even if a fraction of them succeed at disrupting value chains and ecosystems at
    scale, the world could be a different place in a few years. By investing in such
    innovation, we can watch that transition from a nascent state.

    2019 was perhaps the first time we had several quantum technology companies knock
    on our doors for funding. They are first movers, but they also have the unenviable
    job of penetrating or creating a market for their solutions. I am sure that in
    2020, the space will start looking different.

    in a commercial environment. It is going to be an exciting few years where we
    will see excitement, frustration, breakthroughs, roadblocks, and crazy growth.

    of humanity will persist – hope. A hope that we are all working toward a better
    future for the world. A hope that despite all odds, we will arrive at our destination
    and achieve our vision for ourselves, our organizations, our countries, our world,
    and for humanity itself.
