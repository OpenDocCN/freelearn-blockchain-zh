    to change the way we look at cybersecurity. The endless variety of malware family
    has got the capability of being persistent, hidden, self-destructive and can bypass
    traditional security systems by behaving like a legitimate user, making the defenders 
    to adapt a new security approach to achieve a better cyber posture. In this chapter,
    we will understand the different approaches adapted by defenders to combat advanced
    threats and to strengthen cyber security systems.

    innovate and develop an effective solution to address  emerging threats. Organizations
    spend millions of dollars every year to enhance their security posture and tools.
    They keep researching on  zero-day vulnerabilities, building **artificial neural
    network** (**ANN**) for endpoint protection, machine-learning models for new threat
    model,  building an effective cyber security incident response process and awareness
    program etc.

    at Microsoft) and Jeannette M. Wing (Computer Scientist at Carnegie University) have 
    developed a method to measure the attack surface of any  applications and to a
    keep track of every change to the attack surface. They named it as **Relative
    Attack Surface Quotient** (**RASQ**). Their work is motivated by the practical
    problem faced in industry today. The approach to measure relative security between
    systems was inspired by Howard's informal notion of relative attack surface. They
    have added three attack vectors to  Howard's original 17 and showed RASQ calculation
    for five version of Windows

    and NotPetya, use SMB-based vulnerabilities to compromise endpoints. Although
    SMB  is a commonly used Microsoft protocol, an organization with complete visibility
    can separate a good SMB behavior from a bad SMB behavior. Similarly, there are
    various anomalies that are difficult to be protected from using existing security
    systems; however, detection becomes the key to exposing such malicious behaviors
    and even helps in post-infection analysis. This strategy also improves an organization''s
    security posture.'

    found that 99 percent of malware is only seen once before threat actors modify
    it, and it takes both defenders and adversaries in the battlefield of non-stop
    cyberwar. Although high-profile cyberattacks always make breaking news and gain
    the attention of organizations in regards to protecting against these attacks,
    firewalls and antivirus software are necessary as the first line of defense for
    networks and endpoints.'

    it has become a myth to say that you have protection against 100 percent of attacks.
    There are advanced and unknown threats that have never been seen before, and they
    even behave exactly like a legitimate user, and in order to detect and respond
    to such threats, organizations are adopting new approaches with the capabilities
    of dynamic and behavioral analysis, machine learning/deep learning, and attacker
    **techniques, tactics, and procedures** (**TTPs**) analysis.'

    security organizations and experts are continuously exploring new ways to defend
    their organization's critical assets from emerging threats. The bad news is that
    the majority of defenders still treat them just like any other malware; however,
    the fact is cyberattackers have become even more sophisticated, financially motivated,
    and patient in nature. They have become significantly more complex to identify,
    they are manually executing commands and tools (criminals never take risks in
    the case of a bigger target), and attackers penetrate the network from multiple
    avenues of approach simultaneously.

    approach, which is used by implementing *always verify* for all data and assets.
    This was designed to overcome the flat network problem, which helps threat actors
    move undetected through lateral movements and ex-filtrate sensitive and confidential
    information. This approach also empowers the security pros so that they can regain
    control of their network and application. Here is how we get started with the
    zero-trust approach:'

    antivirus, firewall, and next-generation firewall, advanced threats still manage
    to bypass the security system. Hence, none of the security prevention technologies
    can guarantee a complete protection against such threats. In the past few years,
    organizations have adopted a new approach called **assume breach**, which is a
    way of testing their incident response force.

    testing where the exercise is performed by a team of highly professional security

    on the TCP/IP model and use client-server database architecture. The authority
    to modify data remains with the centralized server, which authenticates each client
    before allowing them to access the database. As there is only one server authority
    for regulation and maintenance, if that is compromised, the entire data can be
    altered, exfiltrated, or even deleted. The majority of data-breach incidents are
    basically an effect and risk of having a centralized server database on the cloud.

    and critical gap with one of the most remarkable technology innovations named
