    book. After all, aren't blockchain networks supposed to be decentralized, and
    thus guarded against the control of a single entity? While this is true from a
    technology perspective, the reality is that we are human, and for an enterprise-grade
    blockchain network to succeed, there are a lot of decisions that need to be made
    throughout the life cycle of the network.

    with important and hard decisions. A case in point is the controversy around bitcoin
    block size. In the early days of bitcoin, a limit of 1 MB was set on the block
    size. As the network scaled up, this limit became problematic. Numerous proposals
    were issued, but the need for a consensus across the entirety of bitcoin nodes
    made the change difficult to agree on. This debate started in 2015, but the community
    had to wait until February 2018 for a partial solution, SegWit, to be partially
    adopted. We say partial because **SegWit**, which stands for **segregated witness**,
    only alleviates the problem by separating the signatures from the transaction
    payload, thereby allowing the inclusion of more transactions within a block—a
    lot of discussion and exchanges to reach a partial answer.

    a bank will issue a letter of credit to a seller, stating that provided that the
    terms and conditions are met, payment will be issued. While this process is very
    much ingrained in international trade, the use of letters of credit is a very
