    underlying blockchain in order to build an application. Cryptography is mainly
    used in the consensus and application layers of the blockchain. A hashing algorithm
    is mainly used to create block identity, ensure the integrity of the blockchain,
    and also acts as a key ingredient of consensus algorithms, such as Bitcoin's Proof

    of a blockchain application. The applications of hash functions range from minor
    blockchain implementations, such as creating a digest for a large amount of data,
    to major implementations, such as maintaining the integrity of the blocks in the
    chain. Hash functions are also used in Proof of Work consensus algorithms to solve
    the Byzantine failure problem, which we'll cover in depth, later in the chapter.

- en: As defined in the introductory chapter, a blockchain is a continuously growing
    collection of blocks that are chained together to form an open ledger by using
    cryptography as a key ingredient. Each block in the blockchain is given an identity
    to mark that block as unique, and this is achieved by using the hash functions
    that will generate a digest for that block. The collision resistance property
    of the cryptographic hash function, as mentioned in the previous chapter, [Chapter
    2](bbe822af-c535-4a33-9783-168d174c48c1.xhtml), *A Bit of Cryptography**,* ensures
    that it is infeasible to find two blocks that will result in the same hash value.
    As a result, the hash function guarantees the uniqueness of the identity created
    for the block.

    value. As a result, this would break the chain, as one of the block references
    will be invalid due to the newly generated hash value. Therefore, it''s infeasible
    to modify a block such that it generates the same hash value as before. This is
    due to the pre-image resistance property of the cryptographic hash function, which
    ensures that the data of the blocks cannot be predicted even if we possess the
    hash value. This is why, once a chain of blocks is created, the integrity of the
    chain is ensured as each block references the previous block. The only way to
    modify the data of a block is by modifying all the subsequent blocks by updating
    its reference to the previous block:'

    We also looked at how the cryptographic hash function plays a vital role to ensure

    it doesn't ensure that a single version of blockchain can be maintained in the
    decentralized network. Every node in the network is capable of maintaining their
    own version of blockchain since the block creation is not a difficult task. This
    is a well-known distributed system problem called the Byzantine Generals' Problem,

    It occurs when there is a loss of a service in a system that needs to achieve
    a consensus. This kind of failure is witnessed in distributed systems, where it
    is difficult to gather information about the status of components, and the presence
    of bad actors makes it more difficult to reach a consensus.

    which is an agreement problem in which a group of generals representing the Byzantine
    army are planning to attack a city. Some of the generals might decide to attack,
    whereas others retreat. They should come to an agreement about whether to attack
    or retreat so that the mission would be a success. Communicating the generals'
    votes to each other is a difficult task because they are distant from each other
    and there was no convenient way of communication. Due to this, there would be
    a delay or miscommunication among the generals. The problem is further elevated
    by the presence of unreliable generals as they might try to cheat while casting
    a vote so that the mission fails. If such a system fails to achieve an agreement
    with the majority of votes, it would result in a failed mission because the army
    that decided to attack might not have enough support from the rest of the generals.
    This is a classic agreement problem for which there is no one single solution.
    The solution to the Byzantine General's Problem is to find a majority vote among
    the honest generals.

    Maintaining a single truth in a decentralized network is a difficult task, and
    the involvement of bad actors in the network makes it even more difficult. The
    decentralized network of a blockchain must agree on a single state to make the
    blockchain consistent among all the blockchain nodes. The occurrence of the Byzantine
    problem in a blockchain network is inevitable because blockchain networks exist
    in a decentralized trustless environment. The nodes of the network should reach
    a consensus on how to attain a universal blockchain state. Miners, in particular,
    should reach a consensus because they are the ones that contribute to the growth
    of the blockchain.

    It achieved this by using a consensus algorithm called Proof of Work, which was

    Hashcash was developed to validate legitimate users and reduce email spam by creating
    a stamp that requires some amount of computation. The Hashcash stamp was created
    using a hashing algorithm. Although the stamp creation was time consuming, verification
    could be performed instantly. Similarly, Bitcoin's Proof of Work also uses a cryptographic
    hash function to achieve consensus in the network.

    consensus in a decentralized network, what if a bad actor tries to create an alternate
    blockchain with some fraudulent transactions? This isn't easy when Proof of Work
    is being used. Whenever a bad actor makes a modification to a block that was created
    earlier, all the successive blocks would be recreated, all of which would redo
    the work. Recreating all the blocks would take a very long time as the process
    requires a lot of computation power. However, you'll find that often, the work
    of a bad actor will be rejected by the majority of the network because it was
    not able to keep up with the work done by the honest nodes.

    the nonce really hard and non-deterministic, the only way to find the nonce is
    to actually try out each nonce using the hash function and find a nonce that will
    satisfy the target hash value. Although the solution is non-deterministic, due
    to the properties of hash functions, Proof of Work is affected by probability.
    Although finding the solution depends on luck, the puzzle is often solved by the
    miner node that has done the most work. This is due to the fact that the probability

    hash values. This is again due to the fact that the probability of finding a small

    a great way of establishing trust between parties in a trustless environment.

    the application layer of the blockchain. They are mostly used to validate the
    events in transactions that are inserted in the blocks. They are used to validate
    the transactions, since verification can be performed by anyone who possesses

    be created in the network, as we saw in the previous section of this chapter.
