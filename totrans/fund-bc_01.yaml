  zh: 区块链是什么
- en: Although blockchain has a variety of definitions, a blockchain can best be described
    as a data structure of blocks that are chained together to form a collection of
    records, called a ledger, with cryptography being a key ingredient in the process.
    A blockchain doesn't have a storage mechanism; instead, it has a set of protocols
    that govern the way in which information is forged. So, a blockchain can be stored
    in flat files or in a database.

  zh: 尽管区块链有各种定义，但最好将区块链描述为一个由区块链结构组成的数据结构，这些结构链接在一起形成一个称为分类帐的记录集，其中密码学是该过程的关键因素。
    区块链没有存储机制；相反，它有一组规定信息生成方式的协议。 因此，区块链可以存储在平面文件中或数据库中。
- en: Blockchain technology gained popularity due to the fact that its integrity can't
    easily be compromised. A compromised blockchain can be recognized for what it
    is, and rejected quite easily by anyone in a network. This integrity is achieved
    by cryptography, which is what binds the blocks together; we'll study this idea
    of cryptography in [Chapter 2](bbe822af-c535-4a33-9783-168d174c48c1.xhtml), *A

  zh: 区块链技术之所以受到欢迎，是因为其完整性不容易被破坏。 一个被破坏的区块链可以被识别出来，而且很容易被网络中的任何人拒绝。 这种完整性是通过密码学实现的，这就是将区块绑在一起的东西；
    我们将在[第2章](bbe822af-c535-4a33-9783-168d174c48c1.xhtml)中研究这个密码学的概念，*密码学简介*。
- en: Blockchain's promise of providing such robust integrity is what eventually paved
    the way for the idea of sharing chains of data in untrusted **peer-to-peer** (**P2P**)
    networks. Validation of the blocks in a blockchain is what makes sure that a blockchain
    has a valid global state that can be accepted by everyone. Due to a blockchain's
    ability to share information in an open P2P network without any central authority
    governing it, the technology can have many different applications; however, the
    technology could not simply just be deployed to these applications immediately
    without any troubleshooting. Although blockchain technology, from the beginning,
    had a huge role to play in the decentralization of applications, it still faced
    several challenges with regards to its application in trustless environments.
    One of the biggest challenges was keeping a blockchain consistent across all the
    participants of a P2P network. This was solved by creating a consensus algorithm,
    which agrees on how the blocks should be appended to grow the chain in a trustless
    environment.

  zh: 区块链承诺提供如此强大的完整性，最终为在不受信任的**点对点**（**P2P**）网络中共享数据链的想法铺平了道路。对区块链中的块进行验证是确保区块链具有全局有效状态并可被所有人接受的关键。由于区块链能够在没有任何中央机构管理的开放P2P网络中共享信息，因此该技术可以有许多不同的应用；然而，该技术不能立即在这些应用中部署而不经任何故障排除。尽管区块链技术从一开始就在应用去中心化应用方面发挥了重要作用，但它在应用于无信任环境时仍面临着几个挑战。其中最大的挑战之一是保持区块链在P2P网络的所有参与者之间的一致性。这个问题通过创建共识算法来解决，该算法同意如何在不受信任的环境中添加块以扩展链。

- en: Blockchain's ideal implementation is with atomic events or transactions, where
    minimal information about an event is stored as a transaction; these transactions
    can be clubbed together in a single block and added to a blockchain. Although
    a blockchain network is good at handling a global state, it would not add much
    value when it comes to storing data in bulk, as there would be scalability issues.
    It's very important to understand when best to apply blockchain technology to
    develop an application. We will explore when not to use blockchain in [Chapter

- en: On the other hand, relational databases follow the **create, read, update, and
    delete** (**CRUD**) operation model. Unlike the case with a blockchain, each database
    has an administrator when it is created, and they will assign access control to
    the other users. Relational databases are mostly maintained by a single entity
    who is in control of all the application data, whereas blockchain technology was

- en: Bitcoin was the first decentralized digital currency to solve the problem of
    the double-spending attack. Maintaining an open distributed blockchain with a
    consensus for validating the block was the main thing that made Bitcoin a practically
    implementable decentralized currency. Bitcoin made use of a consensus algorithm
    called the **proof-of-work** (**PoW**) algorithm to prove that a node has actually
    worked to create a new block of the blockchain. This concept was also applied
    in an implementation called Hashcash, which was proposed to limit email spam by
    forcing the spammer to do some work before sending each email. This system prevented
    spammers from sending email in bulk, as a computation task was required before
    each email was sent. All the receiver needed to do was verify the work done by
    the sender. Similarly, the PoW consensus algorithm implemented in Bitcoin prevents
    any node from flooding the blockchain with its own created blocks, thus preventing
    any single entity from dominating the blockchain.

- en: One of the most popular enhancements that came with blockchain 2.0 was the introduction
    of smart contracts. Several blockchain platforms were developed that allowed the
    user to write higher-level scripts and not worry about the actual blockchain implementation.
    One of the platforms that was most successful in doing this was Ethereum, which
    was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin. The intention of Ethereum was to
    make the best use of the technology that Bitcoin used. Bitcoin's initial implementation
    was intended for the flow of digital currency. Now, although a scripting language
    was implemented for other applications, such as asset transfer, it was very primitive
    and only had a few use cases. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, suggested
    that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for decentralized application development
    in order to increase its scope. Failing to gain agreement, Vitalik proposed the
    development of a new platform with a more general scripting language. This platform,
    Ethereum, gained popularity due to the implementation of smart contracts in its
    environment. Smart contracts are high-level scripts that run on the **Ethereum
    Virtual Machine** (**EVM**). A number of decentralized applications have been

    each other, they complete their trade as they trust the third party, which is
    eBay, who assures them both of a legitimate trade. Again, there was a need to

- en: The need for decentralization is the key motivation behind the blockchain technology,
    and decentralization is achieved by distributing the computation tasks to all
    the nodes of the blockchain network. Decentralization solves several problems
    of traditional systems; the single point of failure is one such problem. For example,
    in a centralized system such as a bank, the user would always communicate with
    the same third-party bank to fetch their account details. Although this transaction
    may be possible almost every time, 100% uptime is not guaranteed, as this server
    is centralized and has just a few backup servers for load balancing. There could
    well be a situation where all the servers could be flooded with requests, resulting
    in crashes and server shutdown. This downtime is something that's inevitable,
    even in perfectly architected servers. If the same scenario was faced in a decentralized
    network, it wouldn't be an issue, because all the transaction data would be distributed
    across all the nodes, meaning that each node can act as a backup node in case
    of failure, maintaining the integrity of the data (another key benefit of blockchain-based
    solutions). This is something that's achieved by maintaining a distributed ledger
    of blockchain data. Blockchain immutability, which is a key factor in trusting
    the integrity of the blockchain, ensures the integrity of the ledger, which is
    publicly accessible to all nodes.

- en: A blockchain, put simply, is a chain of blocks that are secured to each other
    via cryptography. Cryptography hash pointers are used as references to link each
    block in the blockchain of the public ledger. Although this sounds very secure
    since no intruder would be able to break the blockchain and insert their own versions
    of the blocks, it's not *completely* secure. Since the ledger is entirely transparent
    and public, any node could insert their block to reproduce the entire blockchain
    and create their own version of it. Eventually, they could later propagate the
    block to every node in the network and prove that their blockchain is the legitimate
    one. This shows that immutability cannot be achieved just by connecting all the
    blocks and forming a secure ledger. Achieving immutability needs to be assisted
    by some kind of decentralized economic mechanism that gives a fair chance to each
    and every node in the network to vote on block creation, and also makes it harder
    to reconstruct blocks once they are appended.

    Bitcoin is implementable in a decentralized environment. The PoW consensus algorithm
    used in Bitcoin was the first – and is still the best known – solution. It promises
    a high degree of immutability to the public ledger and secures it, even in a trustless
    network. In terms of cryptocurrency, the nodes that perform PoW are called **mining
    nodes**. As the name suggests, mining is the act of forging new blocks to be appended
    to the blockchain. The amount of work that it takes to mine ensures that the blockchain
    is immutable and that tampering with any past transactions is nearly impossible.

    these two computing architecture models fluctuate over time. Mainframe architectures
    were used in enterprises to house great amounts of computing power, memory, and
    storage. They were largely centralized, and terminals without much computing power
    were used to connect to these machines in order to perform required operations.
    Then, personal computers were introduced for household usage, with enough computation
    power, memory, and storage to perform basic operations. This gave rise to the

    computation. The server usually performs heavy computing in a distributed system

- en: Each block header will have the components outlined in *Figure 1.4*. These are
    the minimum fields required in a permissionless blockchain, such as Bitcoin, to
    efficiently create a block that can be appended to an immutable blockchain. The **Previous
    Block Hash** field is a reference to the last block created. The **Merkle Root**
    is the value of the Merkle hash tree; it summarizes all the transactions in the
    block. **Timestamp**, **Difficulty Target**, and **Nonce** are used by the PoW
    consensus algorithm to solve the hash puzzle. We'll be revisiting these concepts
    in more depth throughout the book.

    a linked list, but here the blocks are linked by referencing the hash value (identifier)
    of the previous block. Each full node in a blockchain network will maintain a
    complete blockchain and append a new block whenever it has one to append. Due
    to the decentralized nature of the blockchain, each node will verify the block
    before linking it to the local blockchain record.

    blocks to its existing local blockchain. Whenever a node receives a block from
    the network, it checks for the previous block hash. If the hash value matches
    with the hash value of the last block on the node's local blockchain, then the
    node accepts this block and appends it to the current blockchain. As long as this
    is the longest known blockchain, the blocks would be considered valid by all the
    peers in the network in a PoW-based blockchain.

- en: Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, observed
    that the number of components per electrical integrated circuit would grow by
    at least a factor of two for every year. Back in 1965, he also projected that
    this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. Over the years,
    he revised the forecast to doubling every two years. This observation was geared
    toward the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit and has been used
    in the semiconductor industry to set targets for research and development. But
    it isn't only limited to the chip-manufacturing field; it has also been used to
    make observations about technological and social change, as well as productivity
    and economic growth.

    is a technology of the future that might have to overcome multiple limitations

- en: Since every node in the network maintains the complete blockchain ledger, blockchain
    data keeps increasing in size as time goes on. This raises some concerns regarding
    scalability, as each node needs to maintain the blockchain locally (such is the
    nature of the distributed network). Satoshi Nakamoto had mentioned that the growth
    of the block header size would be around 4.2 MB per year, and Moore's law would
    guarantee growth of at least 1.2 GB RAM (in 2008) per year, which should not pose
    any problems for block storage even if they are maintained in node memory.

  zh: 由于网络中的每个节点都维护完整的区块链账本，随着时间的推移，区块链数据的大小不断增加。这引发了一些关于可伸缩性的担忧，因为每个节点都需要在本地维护区块链（这是分布式网络的性质）。中本聪曾提到，区块头大小的增长率每年约为
    4.2 MB，而摩尔定律将保证每年至少增长 1.2 GB RAM（在 2008 年），即使这些数据存储在节点内存中也不会造成任何问题。
