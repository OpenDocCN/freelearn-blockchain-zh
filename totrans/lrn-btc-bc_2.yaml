    understand blockchain technology and its architecture, you should be hearing a
    lot about decentralization. It is one of the buzzwords used more frequently in
    the cryptocurrency space and is often considered as the sole purpose of blockchain
    technology. Decentralization sounds like it is the opposite of something that
    is centralized, but it is far more than that.

    assets model, and P2P technology. It led to a new architectural era that helped
    in building massively scalable and profitable applications, a new type of software
    referred to as **decentralized applications (****Dapps)**. Now let's go through
    the three types of applications and their differences. Most of the applications
    that we use are based on a centralized or client-server model. A few discs are
    distributed, but now more and more are becoming decentralized.

    are single instance systems running in a standalone system. The decisions for
    the system goal are created in the central mechanism and are then transferred
    to the executive components or people. They do everything in a single node. All
    executives rely on the central mechanism to take actions, for example, traditional
    corporations, wherein we have just one CEO or CXO who governs the entire corporation
    or central laws of a nation. Federal reserve authorities and financial institutions

    instead of one computer or single instance. It means that not one single entity
    has control over all the processing. Decentralized computing is the allocation
    of resources to each and every workstation on hardware and software. Basically,
    none of the nodes inform any other node on what is to be done. Decentralized systems
    bring decision locality, which means that the system''s components operate on
    local information to accomplish goals, rather than the result of the central ordering
    influence. By nature, this implies that it is distributed among various parties.
    A key point about decentralization is that there is no central point of control.
    No one entity controls the others, which is why we said that no node is informing
    any other nodes of what to do, for example, BitTorrent, which was used for downloading
    large video files or movies. Blockchain, for that matter, is a classic example
    of a decentralized system.'

    but most of them are centralized because the company running them can alter or
    stop the system all the way, which brings us to an important aspect of distributed
    systems. The distributed system consists of autonomous components connected using
    distribution middleware. These components communicate with each other in order
    to achieve the same goal. The components are located on the networked computers,
    and they communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. Distributed
    means not all the processing of the transaction is done in one simple, single,
    or same place. This does not mean that those distributed processors aren''t under
    the control of a single entity. State-level governments are a classic example
    of distributed systems. Gas stations, for that matter, are again another example.
    When we think of a gas station, we know that there are Shell stations all over,
    yet not all gas stations are Shell, which brings us to another important aspect
    wherein decentralized systems are also distributed systems, but every distributed
    system does not necessarily have to be a decentralized system.'

    assets such as bonds or stocks to the other participant, while the other participant
    pays currency against those assets being transferred to them. This trading of
    assets can very well be decentralized. You can have atomicity between trading

    dollar? This can be achieved when a bank or a consortium of banks agree that they
    will bank this colored coin of 1 dollar and that they will maintain the ratio.
    So, this entity will have to ensure that this one-to-one ratio is being maintained
    throughout. Similarly, the entity that repossesses the digital stocks must ensure
    that the digital stock is equivalent to the physical stock. They need to get an

    investors but have to go through a very lengthy process, which includes legal
    activities. The most difficult and cumbersome part is that such start-ups usually
    need to first approach an intermediary or a broker who then connects them to the
    real investors. Needless to mention, these brokers charge a hefty percentage of
    an amount as a brokerage fee, besides the time taken to complete the transactions.
    Decentralization can completely democratize the investing process by eliminating
    intermediaries and placing the power and the control where it belongs, which is
    entirely in the hands of the investors. Crowdfunding over the blockchain enables
    ordinary people to access investment opportunities that they will otherwise never
    see. The exciting feature of crowdfunding with cryptocurrencies is that it allows
    the investor to trade the investment immediately on the trading platform available.
    With the help of decentralized blockchain platforms, start-ups can create their
    own cryptocurrency, crypto coins, or crypto tokens, backed by their future revenue
    generation plan. These crypto coins are usually backed by real currency, with
    an appropriate ratio for each coin. They can then, by using the decentralized

    the store in exchange for money. This completes one transaction. Then, the store
    executes another transaction where they sell this car to someone else in exchange
    for money. In this example, you really do not bother about any customer who purchases
    the car. Another example would be **eBay**. eBay is yet another auction platform.
    It matches the participants based on their needs and routes payments. **PayPal**
    is another platform, which is a payment processing platform. It does not do any
    matching of participants or auctions. It simply provides some payment options

    swiftly. So, the premise on these markets can be governed through crypto tokens
    such as Ether or Bitcoin. The ownership transfer can be done using smart contracts
    and atomic digital transfers of assets. Dispute handling can be done by using
    **escrow** or **consensus** to some limited level, which in turn helps mediate
    the disputes as well. When it comes to matching the bits, we can use consensus
    and smart contracts to match and get approval from the selling entity. Miners

- en: Let's now look at the next category for decentralization. Centralized markets,
    such as exchanges, are yet another classic case to be decentralized. Online exchanges
    bring lack of trust and hence have a middle man who establishes the trust. A decentralized
    exchange is an exchange market that does rely on a third-party service to hold
    the customers' funds. Instead, trades occur directly between users, that is, P2P,
    through an automated process. This system can be achieved by creating proxy tokens
    such as crypto assets that represent a certain cryptocurrency or asset that represent
    shares in a company or through a decentralized, multi-signature escrow system.
    Among all the solutions that are currently being developed, this system contrasts
    with the current centralized model, in which users deposit their funds and they
    exchange issues an IOU that can be freely traded on the platform. When a user
    asks to withdraw his funds, these are converted back into the cryptocurrency that
    they represent and are sent to their owners. **Ripple** is an example of an exchange
    platform that decentralizes the currency exchange and provides cross-border remittance
    by using the transitive trust.

    markets:'

    scrutinizing, and courier fees, yield higher charges. As the scope of the stock
    market gets wider and wider, the administration cost keeps on increasing.
  prefs:

    asymmetry, that leads to market advantages to those who have access to this information.
    There is always a concern to do with forged security and asymmetric counterparty
    risk.

    and decentralized hubs can be eliminated and the decentralized blockchain based
    implementation can be used, which will help to directly transfer the shared ownership
    between the investors, using P2P communication and consensus mechanism. Besides
    this, the decentralized ledger which gets updates within a minute could also save
    millions spent on collateral and settlement costs. Decentralization can cut inefficiencies
    in the share settlement function, trades being settled by P2P communication cuts
    the middleman out, resulting in a lesser cost of record-keeping. Due to P2P communication,
    the settlement can happen in real time instantaneously. Needless to say, above
    all of this, all these being on the shared ledger brings a lot of transparency.

    bring in the banking sector. The typical key routine or procedures carried out
    in banks on daily basis are **know your customer** (**KYC**)and **p****ayments
    and fund transfers**.We will look into the KYC processes as well as the payments
    and transfers. While using the compliance platform and KYC processes, we have
    umpteen challenges. We will get a detailed gist of these challenges in the points
    as follows:'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    bank.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will now discuss what impact decentralization brings in the section. By using
    the compliance platform and KYC process of decentralized blockchain technology,
    banks can reduce operation costs and increase efficiency. KYC can be performed
    once and can then be made available as a reference for other future transactions.
    Moreover, once these KYC details are made available on blockchain, they can be
    used by other banks, accredited institutions, or organizations without the need
    to re-initiate the KYC for the same customer again and again. This will save the
    cost spent on the repeated KYC process, the time spent on completing the KYC,
    and it enables faster and more accurate travel of records. Banks and financial
    institutions can attract customers since they will improve the ease of work and
    the speed of work, and the customers will need to be provided with the KYC documents
    only once.

    transfer transaction takes place across the border and invoice for an exchange.
    Let''s say Jessie needs or wants to transfer 1,000 dollars from her US account
    to her friend John in India. We can see the transfer transaction for Jessie and
    John in the following diagram:'

  prefs: []

    account is in the US and involves third-party foreign exchange that is present
    in the US and third-party foreign exchange that is present in India since John
    holds his account in India. The money moving across all these accounts take a
    considerable amount of time, usually anything between 5 and 7 days.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    same-day transfer from one account to other, we are talking about at least 4 to
    5 days minimum.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third challenge is private bookkeeping. Each bank keeps its own bookkeeping
    record privately. This leads to increased time needed for validating proof of
    ownership of funds.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is not guaranteed to get the desired exchange rate due to the time is taken by
    the entire process. Moreover, there is no clarity on why a particular rate was
    applied.
  prefs:

    to state the number of charges applied by all these intermediaries and banks.

    in the sector:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, if this entire foreign exchange process is brought onto the decentralized
    blockchain platform, the first benefit is in is the elimination of the intermediaries
    that claim to establish the trust for the transactions. This reduces the time
    taken at least by half. Now, how do we establish trust in this transaction?
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, let the P2P consensus bring transitive trust. Real or fiat currency can
    be represented in crypto tokens or assets digitally. These tokens can be then
    transferred through the blockchain program from Jessie to John, almost in seconds.
    The transaction can be executed in minutes, if not in seconds. It brings transparency
    in the actual rate applied, speeds up the transaction, reduces the charges or
    fees drastically, and establishes a secure and transparent book of records for
    future compliance purposes.

- en: After going through the journey of understanding decentralization in detail,
    we now have reached the end of this section. In this section, we will look at
    some of the most important pros and cons of decentralization. Over the past few
    decades, the technology advancements and innovations have helped mankind and this
    world make good progress and growth. However, at the same time, any such innovations
    in technology have also exposed the dark side of the internet and has shown us
    the misuse of the technology itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The internet, for example, has its benefits but also has its disadvantages as
    well. People misuse the internet for hacking online systems and various other
    scams. It is not primarily the pitfall of the technology, but the usage of it
    with wrong intentions. The coin always has two sides and we are talking about
    the crypto coin here. Similar to the internet, even decentralization and blockchain
    have their own pros and cons. So, let's look at some of those at a broad level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, one of the most significant benefits of blockchain is that it is a
    distributed network rather than being a centralized one. Transactions can be verified
    by a widely spread P2P global network of nodes. This means if someone wants to
    manipulate the data present on the blockchain, they will need to get access to
    all the computers in the distributed network, at the same time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The computing power needed to conduct such a hack can be compared to something
    equivalent of the hashing for money. In this example, you really do not bother
    about any customer who power of a nation or state and all the technology companies
    therein to overcome more than 51% computational power of the entire network, which
    is next to impossible. This eliminates the single point of failure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'But looking at the cons part of it, there are still possibilities of hacking
    and manipulation of data. There are several types of hacks that are possible if
    the decentralized blockchain platform is not devised to safeguard from them. Let
    us discuss the hacks:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Miner**: For example, a 51% attack is considered as an inherent setback of
    public blockchains. One who has reputed the maximum to the network''s mining hash
    rate has the ability to manipulate the ledger as per desire. In simple words,
    if you are a miner and are mining more than 51% of the blocks on a blockchain,
    then you can potentially change the ledger contents in all the blocks that are
    being written hereafter.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Eclipse:** Another type of hacking called an Eclipse attack involves crippling
    of one of the nodes in such a way that it fails to interact with all other nodes.
    This way, the percentage of mining hash rate does not pose as a restricting attribute
    and the remaining nodes probably may take the highest side of mining, dictating
    the rest of the blocks.'

    a medium to ask for money from the public, for example, the **Ransomware** virus
    attack.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Bank vulnerability:** Even banks are vulnerable to fraud and robbery. A recent
    example would be when a group of hackers took control of all online and ATM operations
    of a large bank in Brazil. They got access to passwords, credit cards, and all
    other personal information of the individuals. This attack provided them with
    money and additional private information which can be used for future attacks
    as well.'

- en: Decentralization primarily eliminates intermediaries such as banks due ti which
    such information of value would not have had a central point of access. Due to
    its tamper-evident structure and immutability, the decentralized blockchain technology
    can help detect corruption and fraud in the government organizations as well.
    For example, the Silk Road online case which was shut down by the Federal Bureau
    of Investigation a few years ago. It was a darknet marketplace and consisted of
    a nexus of unlawful elements, which even the federal agencies were not able to
    trace. It was the decentralized blockchain ledger that helped the federal to uncover
    the real culprits who were covering up the evidence. The people who were actually
    the federal agents were the culprits and were part of the investigation team itself.
    This was only uncovered because of the decentralized, immutable, no single owner
    ledger of the blockchain platform.

- en: On the flip side of it, while decentralization eliminates the need for an intermediary
    or a middleman, over decades the whole world has been operating and is being driven
    by intermediary agencies only. Such intermediary agencies have been making money
    year on year. Besides this, due to its underlying complexities, blockchain and
    decentralization are not that easy for people to understand. The cryptography,
    the blockchain, the decentralization, and all the jargon are tough for them to
    understand. So, there will be a lot of resistance to accepting decentralization,
    especially in government organizations and some of the key agencies in the society.

- en: On the decentralized blockchain, anything that is worth the value can be transferred
    between entities and saved safely and confidentially. This restricts our attempt
    to alter with the wrong intention because the person has to find specific data
    for a particular individuals transaction. The anonymity on a decentralized platform
    can act as a two-edged sword: while it maintains confidentiality, it also helps
    the scammers and unlawful people who use it for their own advantages, to carry
    out illegal trades and transactions while remaining anonymous.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The security provided by the decentralized blockchain is achieved using cryptography
    and restricting the changes to the data written on the blockchain. This immutability
    keeps the data safeguarded lifelong. However, since transactions or data return
    on the platform is irreversible, any data that was mistakenly written and has
    to be corrected needs to be rewritten as a new record. One can only add corrected
    data as the new transaction. This, of course, needs to undergo additional computation,
    verification by the nodes, network sharing, and so on.
