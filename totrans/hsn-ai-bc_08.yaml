    cryptocurrency markets are highly unregulated markets and are therefore deemed
    by many nations as high-risk for retail investors. The techniques identified in
    this chapter should NOT be considered as financial advice. Before experimenting
    with these techniques, it is imperative that you understand the trading strategies,
    along with their pros and cons. We do not recommend you use any of these techniques
    without financial advice. Without consulting your financial advisor, executing
    any of these trade strategies could lose your principal investment amount, and
    may also cause unexpected corrections in the markets. The author and the publisher
    will not be responsible for any financial losses accrued by experimenting with
    the techniques mentioned in this chapter.'

    operations in a personal capacity as well as in an institutional capacity. This
    has reduced dependencies across the value chain, and, in some cases, has disintermediated
    the role of the stakeholders. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and
    Ripple (under some constraints) have enabled a large number of people to disintermediate
    or explore new white spaces in the economy, including concepts such as **Non-Fungible
    Tokens** (**NFTs**), an **Initial Coin Offering** (**ICO**), and a **Decentralized

    to analyze and predict prices using simple ML models. Hence, the ARIMA model is
    used to predict the price. Consider the time-series example of Bitcoin, as depicted
    in the previous diagram. We cannot attribute changes to one single parameter and
    develop a linear regression model that satisfies our requirement of price prediction
    independently. Hence, ARIMA is widely used so that we can apply the model, make
    a note of the error in prediction, retest the model after making the necessary
    changes, and calculate the MSE again.

    ranging from 3% to 5%. The key advantage of ARIMA is that the model is fairly

    is called algorithmic trading. As the name suggests, the trade calls made by these
    machines are optimized to look at profits that humans cannot sense by reading
    charts and reports. These calls take place in a split sub-second and are predicted
    to take over finance as we know it.

    practice of leveraging different prices of the same asset in two different locations
    in order to profit from the difference in the economic values of the asset in
    trade transactions. Simply put, arbitrage is a trading strategy that exploits
    the different economic values of the same asset in two or more markets. You can
    buy it in the market where the price is cheaper and sell it to markets with higher
    demands.

    and sell them at a premium in Greece.

    Arbitrage was applicable to traditional financial instruments dating back to as
    early as the 1980s in modern finance. It is actively pursued as a trading strategy,
    even today.

    arbitrage of Bitcoin, let's understand some basic context. At the time of writing,
    Bitcoin—often referred to by its ticker symbol, **Bitcoin** (**BTC)**—is listed
    across more than 100 exchanges ([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/)),
    with slight differences in prices at different exchanges.

    USD 2 if there is a way to instantaneously purchase Bitcoins in exchange 1 and
    sell the same bitcoins to trading users in exchange 2\. However, it is naive to
    assume that both the transactions can occur near-instantly in order to profit
    from this trade. If this trade can be achieved successfully, a crypto/fiat arbitrage
    has been successfully established.

    between two kinds of cryptocurrency. Assume that 1 **BTC **costs 50 **Ethers**
    (**ETH**) in exchange 1\. Assume that the same quantity of 1 BTC costs 60 ETH
    in exchange 2\. Algorithmic trading in this scenario would identify the best-fitting
    cryptocurrency trade pairs that can return maximum profits and execute the trade,
    thereby profiting 10 ETH in less than a few seconds. If such a trade can be achieved
    successfully, a crypto/crypto arbitrage has been successfully established.

- en: '**Market making** is a crucial process in the crypto trading business, with
    the important goal of offering liquidity to cryptocurrencies in the market. Let''s
    explore this in detail, as follows: buying parties in the markets place a bid
    (the **bid**) for purchasing a particular crypto asset. A seller with an intent
    to sell the same type of crypto asset may place their asking price (the **ask**)
    for the asset. Usually, the values from the buyer and seller do not match because
    the buyers usually quote for less value and the sellers quote for more value.
    This can create a gap between the expectations between both parties, thereby creating
    a **spread**.'
  id: totrans-113
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the disagreement on the mutual price grows, the spread value widens and
    creates an illiquid token or cryptocurrency. Illiquid tokens are basically non-tradeable
    since expectations are not matched. Hence, lower trade volumes create a slowdown
    for the token and reduce the market capitalization of the respective token. This
    is detrimental to the business. Hence, there is a need for liquidity providers
    who can help both buyers and sellers meet in the middle.
