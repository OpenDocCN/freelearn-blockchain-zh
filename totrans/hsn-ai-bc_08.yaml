    used to predict the price. Consider the time-series example of Bitcoin, as depicted
    in the previous diagram. We cannot attribute changes to one single parameter and
    develop a linear regression model that satisfies our requirement of price prediction
    independently. Hence, ARIMA is widely used so that we can apply the model, make
    a note of the error in prediction, retest the model after making the necessary
    changes, and calculate the MSE again.

    creates an illiquid token or cryptocurrency. Illiquid tokens are basically non-tradeable
    since expectations are not matched. Hence, lower trade volumes create a slowdown
    for the token and reduce the market capitalization of the respective token. This
    is detrimental to the business. Hence, there is a need for liquidity providers
    who can help both buyers and sellers meet in the middle.

    and offering them a retail value for smaller investors. The revenue model for
    market makers is constructed by buying tokens in bulk at lower prices and selling
    at higher prices to takers in the future.

    challenge to identify the liquidity demands in the crypto trading landscape as
    there are more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies actively traded without borders or
    time zones. Hence, it has been imperative to apply some of the DL techniques such
    as evolutionary algorithms to identify all possible scenarios where liquidity
    may be in demand for a particular targeted list of cryptocurrencies.

- en: India has long been one of the few developing countries with an uncertain position
    on cryptocurrencies. A circular from the **Reserve Bank of India** (**RBI**) dated
    February 12, 2018 advised all the banks and RBI-regulated institutions against
    supporting any individual or entities involved in virtual currencies. This was
    considered as a blanket ban on all activities pertaining to cryptocurrencies,
    although exchanges in India were unable to support deposits or withdrawals associated
    with bank accounts.

    RBI circular, thereby striking down RBI's ban on financial institutions rendering
    services to these exchanges and traders alike ([https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2018/19230/19230_2018_4_1501_21151_Judgement_04-Mar-2020.pdf](https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2018/19230/19230_2018_4_1501_21151_Judgement_04-Mar-2020.pdf)).

    model to many other developing countries and economies, there are larger uncertainties
    looming around the ecosystem. At the time of writing, RBI has reportedly filed
    a review petition to challenge the verdict given by the country's Apex court.
    It is also notable that **Anti-Money Laundering** (**AML**) and **Know Your Customer**
    (**KYC**) regulations are to be updated in order to support these businesses without
    harming the country's economy.

    leader of the next wave of the digital economy. Until then, such uncertainties

    economies. Starting with the key differentiation between fiat and cryptocurrencies,
    we have introduced you to various practices in the cryptocurrency market such
    as trading, prediction, arbitrage, and market making. We have not only introduced
    you to the basic concepts but also identified the key issues faced by traders
    in the industry. Finally, we have introduced some approaches to solving the problems
    using AI and aiming for better, more efficient, and higher-profit-making models
    using several AI techniques such as ARIMA, LSTM, and so on.
