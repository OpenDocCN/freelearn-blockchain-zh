    AI and blockchain technologies. We will examine how these technologies could be
    used together to solve some of the biggest problems affecting many industries
    and our planet. In this chapter, I have also made multiple suggestions that could
    be used as new ideas for academic projects by interested students and faculties.
    If you are a working professional or an enthusiast, you could still consider using
    the ideas as a side project and work with people who would like to brainstorm
    on new ideas in their leisure time.

    as MoiBit ([www.MoiBit.io](http://www.moibit.io)) to store the necessary diagnostic
    files. These files can be hosted by the mobile owner and used by personnel for
    further examination of the problem with strict sharing options set by the owner.

    owner in the mobile company's retail side of the supply chain management software.
    Instead of a silo system, this supply chain would be a consortium of phone manufacturers,
    who could also recognize the owner of this premium phone, meaning that one DID
    could represent the ownership of one or more mobiles.

    can use MoiBit due to its ease of use and also the granular level of access control
    you could use to provide privacy to the owner of the mobile (before and after
    purchasing the phone).

    securely in their own dedicated infrastructure or a common network without paving
    the way for centralization or illicit data mining activities. Once the phone is
    able to log all the data, we just need to apply predictive maintenance machine
    learning algorithms to ensure that customer service is available even before the
    user identifies the need for help.

    To enforce transparency in audit and bring accountability to the access given
    to such sensitive data, we require all verified personnel to perform service-related
    operations through a specific wallet address. These wallet addresses can be further
    enhanced with the help of DIDs and name services such as the **Ethereum Name Service**

    them in cryptocurrency for each successful review submission. This will help incentivize
    users to provide genuine feedback for each service instance rendered by the app.
    In this process of collecting user reviews, companies would also be able to solve
    some of the current inefficiencies and cut the costs associated with a particular

    normal operations, but identifies each user with a decentralized identifier DID.
    This is step 1 on the road to user privacy. With the DID, you could associate
    a wallet that is used to remit a digital currency for every successful review.
    You could also consider applying form validation and rate limiting techniques
    to ensure that bad actors are not gaming this system just to collect the rewards.
    If the rules of the app consider the review content compelling enough, a bot can
    be used to quickly remit the digital currency and also start a dialogue with the
    user, notifying them that the feedback is greatly appreciated.

    a little more on the problem. This is called an **interactive feedback system**.
    Any extended information received by users via chatbot can later be tokenized
    and sent to models using narrative analysis and content analysis. Using this approach,
    the new enhanced versions of the app are poised to receive more feedback, elevate
    the quality of service, and also cut down costs as regards unnecessary components

    **Central Board of Direct Taxes** (**CBDT**) reportedly collected around 11.17
    lakh crores in **Indian Rupees** (**INR**). Although this figure seems staggering,
    it has been reported that the collected amount is still in a shortfall of around
    83,000 crores, accounting for nearly 7.4% of the collection target that had been
    set. Similarly, indirect taxes will also be collected at the point of service.
    The amount of indirect tax collected may directly depend upon the state of the
    economy, wherein the buyer has enough purchasing power to afford a product or
    service. The medium of payment can also directly affect the collection of indirect
    taxes, as it becomes extremely difficult to trace cash transactions taking place

    the movement of goods across multiple stakeholders. Based on the transfer or sale
    of such resources, an invoice can be automatically generated by the smart contract

    unit of the raw material. Later on, once the product is manufactured from the
    raw materials, the corresponding NFTs could be burned and a new NFT created that
    is a composite of all the NFTs belonging to the raw materials used in the product.
    The sale of the product is now an auditable record persisted on the network, with
    a clear relationship establishing the composition. This will not only make the
    recording of input and output taxes easier, but it will also enable more tax collection
    along the way.

    companies can expect doctors or any relevant certifiers to stake money on the
    blockchain before allowing them to approve any claims. This could also significantly
    reduce the losses arising from fraud claims. In case a claim is known to be fraud,

    on the data available. Also, it is important that any adverse effect of using
    a drug is commonly reported to local drug administration authorities, as applicable.
    Pharmacovigilance software is being used to report such cases. At the time of

    they are instructed to consume a prescribed amount of a given drug. Drug consumption
    is monitored over a period of time to observe the reaction, understand more about
    the side effects, and gather useful information from the test. This information
    may be passed on to the drug formulation team to improve the product over the
    next iterations. During the course of testing, the subject may experience a number
    of adverse effects, including death. Local drug administration agencies may require
    the drug manufacturers to confirm such scenarios and debrief such adverse instances
    in a prescribed format detailing the cause. Due to the sensitivity attached to
    the personal information of the subject, not all the reporting data can be made
    accessible to the general public or other concerned authorities.'

    can be used in pharmacovigilance software to establish transparency and provenance
    of the reports published by the respective stakeholders. AI can also be used to
    analyze critical data points from the reports and help confirm whether the adverse
    situations, such as the death of the subject, were caused by the drug alone, or
