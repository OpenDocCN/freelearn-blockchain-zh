    key to unlock its Bitcoin outputs or its value. Bitcoins are stored in wallets.
    These wallets are collections of public and corresponding private keys, where
    the public keys are represented by the Bitcoin address. If your Bitcoins are not
    at a Bitcoin address that you directly control, they are not under your control
    at all. It is said that if you do not have the keys, you do not have control of
    the Bitcoins. Basically, you only own the Bitcoins when you own the corresponding
    private keys. If a third-party obtains one or more of the private keys that are
    saved in your wallet, they can use any coins previously received by that public-private
    key pair or combination. Such a transaction doesn''t have to be made using your
    wallet. It can be brought into any device, from anywhere. This is a design feature
    of Bitcoin that allows, among other things, the ability to import and export addresses
    between wallets. This is as good as your credit card PIN. You certainly do not
    want to let an unknown person know your PIN.'

    have been hacked and have had Bitcoins stolen from them. This type of invasion
    seeks a connection to the essence of the servers of the service where the account
    credentials and wallets are reserved. A simple way to avoid security breaches
    that are caused by third-parties is to not store cryptocurrencies on an exchange.
    If your particular trading or investment strategy requires you to preserve the
    balance of cryptocurrencies on your exchange, you must check the access funds

    This always engages all kinds of hackers who try to attack the rookies. The most
    common Bitcoin scam is a **Bitcoin Doubler**. Operators of such con schemes state
    that they will give you back 5%, 100%, or even 200% on your deposits in a short
    space of time. Well, Bitcoin is fairly uncontrolled and nobody will come to your
    rescue when your savings are lost. This is an important part and an added security
    part for cryptocurrency investors. It is to do with two-factor authentication.
    It is necessary that investors use wallets and exchanges that force **two-factor
    authentication** (**2FA**). This needs a user to confirm their identity with more
    than a simple password. Users need to use fingerprints, knowledge of personal
    data, or validation from a secondary device to utilize 2FA, and this feature should
    be enabled by all users. While this may delay the login time, it may save you
    from an expensive hacking crisis. Remember that 2FA cannot secure access to your online
    account, but it can act as a tollgate while carrying out any purchases or sales
    involving coins.

    to your coins is not possible. Coins that cannot be accessed are treated as lost
    forever. Backups are a must when handling important data, especially when the
    data is something to do with your money or cryptocurrencies. This is something
    that should be naturally followed. A good backup strategy is your safety net against
    the loss of your Bitcoin wallet due to hardware drive failures or natural disasters.
    If your hardware drive dies or if your computer is lost or stolen and you don''t
    have a backup of the Bitcoins, they are gone. You can check with your wallet service
    provider or software about which files to back up. A good strategy is a **3-2-1
    strategy**. Number **3** is three backups on two different media devices, such
    as an external hard drive or a USB flash drive; number **2** is to store them
    on your paper wallet; and finally, number **3** is to store them at a remote location
    or your friend''s house. This 3-2-1 strategy has often helped people to prevent
    their cryptocurrencies from being stolen. If a wallet offers protection for your
    password, ensure that you use it. This feature conceals a wallet file, that is,
    the `file.dat` file, or something that is the same as the `file.dat` file, which
    stores private keys and any metadata that may harm your privacy if leaked. Even
    if an attacker tries to hack into your computer and gets access to the file, it
    will be of no use as it is encrypted and cannot be used without the password.
    A word of caution: use a strong password that is difficult to assume or crack.
    The **Hierarchical ****Deterministic** (**HD**) wallet uses the HD or VIP protocol,
    in which a backup has to be performed once, which consists of 12 or 24 human readable
    words that you can write down and keep in a secure place. Daily backups are not
    needed and whenever you want to restore your wallet, it will ask for these words
    in the exact same sequence.'

- en: '**Better to go offline or cold**: If you will not use your cryptocurrency for
    a long time, say a few months or a year or two, you need to keep your currency
    safe and prevent easy access. You can use offline wallets, as these are the most
    secure storage, where private keys are both developed and reserved offline. This
    greatly reduces the danger of coins being stolen by hackers or malignant software.
    Find the cold storage solution that is suitable for you. If you plan on holding
    a small amount of Bitcoins for any length of time, say three months or more, the
    best thing to do is to move them offline and off your computer. A paper wallet
    is a piece of paper with a private key engraved on it, and it is usually in the
    form of a QR code. Some paper wallets can be printed, so you can record your balance
    without importing the private key to a different wallet. You can securely develop
    a paper wallet and keep it safe in your personal vault. Payment for products and
    services that are offered by the site are not needed. Next is the hardware wallet—they
    are tiny devices or smart cards that can be connected to your computer, phone,
    or USB. This type of wallet is generally the most securely guarded because the
    private keys are stored offline and they never leave the device at all. Funds
    can be sent by users from their hardware wallets to exchange and trade them. At
    the same time, it ensures security for the bulk of their investments. **Trezor**,
    for example, is a hardware wallet that provides a high level of security without
    sacrificing convenience. Another benefit is that Trezor can sign a transaction
    while connected to an online device. That means spending Bitcoins is safe even
    when using a compromised computer.'

    Based on your trading pattern and the amount of coins you trade daily, weekly,
    and monthly, you can store your cryptocurrencies in different wallets. You can
    use a number of wallets such as on desktops, mobiles, or even an offline wallet.
    In general, your largest stock can be stored in a hardware wallet, which is more
    secure. You can alternatively store it in a paper wallet and secure this paper
    in your personal vault. Some coins can be stored in your desktop or HD wallet,
    while a small amount of coins can be stored online for regular trading purposes.
    This makes life easier.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will take as an example the **Ledger Nano S** wallet, which is a well-known
    hardware wallet. You can see the diagram or the picture of the wallet that comes
    with a USB extension and can be connected to laptops or computers. When the ledger
    device turns on for the very first time, it uses an algorithm to figure out how
    to use a set of 24 regular words to get a seed. They are usually words with letters,
    for example, four to five letters, which form one word. Basically, there are words,
    which will be randomly picked up, and it produces a seed. Keys for wallets are
    generated from the seed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also specifies a way to annex these 24 words with an additional passphrase,
    which counts as word number 25\. If no passphrase is selected, an empty one is
    used. So, it is necessary to always have the 24 words plus one passphrase, which
    could be empty. Also, remember that a passphrase is different from the passwords
    that we use in various applications as well. A valid seed is produced when any
    passphrase is combined with 24 words. It is advisable that the user writes these
    24 words down on a piece of paper, usually the one that comes in the box with
    the ledger, and keeps that paper safe and away from the ledger itself. For example,
    let's say you have jotted down the four or five digit PIN of your credit or debit
    card, and you keep the paper along with the debit card or credit card; it is highly
    possible that someone can get access to your card and the paper, and then get
    full access to your account. To ensure that this breach doesn't take place, it
    is advisable to keep the paper on which you have written your PIN away from the
    card itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, this developed seed number is used to produce a root key, which is a mix
    of letters and numbers that cannot be predicted. Every blockchain of cryptocurrency
    has its own method of producing the root key from the seed. This key is then used
    to develop a number of private keys that then become cryptocurrency wallets for
    the cryptocurrency blockchain, which the user is keen on. In addition to that,
    the ledger device then requires the use of a PIN, which can be a combination of
    four to eight digits. This is an additional measure taken to safeguard the device.
    However, if the PIN is wrongly logged in three times in a row on your sequence,
    the ledger device automatically destroys all the data, making it useless to anyone
    who has access to it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the ledger gets destroyed, stolen, or lost, the question arises about how
    the user can get access to the keys, the wallet, and the currency in it? The original
    owner of the device can then use the words on the piece of paper to restore its
    contents, either on a backup ledger, another ledger, or any software wallet, thus
    regaining all funds and addresses. This is possible because all we need to do
    is develop the root key, the 24 words, and the passwords, if provided when creating
    the words in the seed.

    around for years, but they are not part of the mainstream trading platforms. There
    are very few companies that are involved in this untried and relatively raw industry.
    Some try to appeal to consumers through quality and the use of precious metals,
    such as gold and silver. Some offer good designs at relatively low prices, while
    some offer neither of these. The market for physical coins is very limited, and
    this is a place for collectors. Rather than being truly practical, physical Bitcoins
    are usually marketed as conversation pieces, such as limited series collectibles.
    At times, these are also referred to as "gifts for geeks". Some of the well-known
    physical Bitcoins are Casascius, Titan Bitcoin, Alitin Mint, and Cryptomint Coins.
    There are other physical Bitcoins that are available that can be looked upon as

    understand what offers they have and read the white papers they have probably
    published. At times, it is worth doing research on the founding members themselves,
    such as how much credibility and experience they bring to the industry. Also,
    check whether they have ICO ratings provided to them by individual third-parties.
    Most importantly, one must know when to exit from ICOs. What is advisable is that
    one must buy the ICO when it is published in the market and hyped and sell those
    when they list in publish exchanges, making a margin difference gain. One more

    technology's life expectancy is proportional to its age. This concept is called
    the **Lindy effect**. Let's take an example of a best selling book published in
    2017, and let's compare it to the Bible, which has been around for over 300 years
    now. If you are asked about which book is more likely to still be in print in
    the next 100 years, the answer would obviously be the Bible, as it has a higher
    probability of survival. It has nothing to do with the contents of the book, it
    is just simple math. An idea that has survived for such a long period of time
    is and will likely continue in the same trend. A new book's contents might be
    relevant in today's world, but who is to really know if the hype will decline
    or reduce? The true test of any idea or technology is its survival over time.
    If the same is applied to Bitcoin, we can say that the longer Bitcoin survives,
    the stronger the idea of decentralized cryptocurrency becomes. If you look at
