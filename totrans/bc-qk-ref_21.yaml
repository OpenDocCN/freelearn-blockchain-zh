    is not without its own issues. Blockchain technology is still in the early stages
    of its development, and a number of problems have cropped up that are still awaiting
    some level of resolution. Decentralized networks such as blockchains have their
    own unique challenges.

- en: One of the key advantages of blockchain is decentralization, which is the removal
    of any single authority to control the network. Unfortunately, this has a downside,
    which is its effect on the performance of a system. Blockchain systems work by
    keeping all the nodes of the network in sync by trying to achieve consensus so
    that every computer running a blockchain sees the same system state. More nodes
    on the network typically results in less centralization. This also means that
    more work must be done to ensure that all the network participants are in agreement
    with each other, which limits performance and scalability.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each node typically must process all transactions. The higher the number of
    transactions to be processed, the more processing power and network throughput
    that each node requires. As requirements go up, the network becomes less decentralized
    as fewer and fewer groups can afford to put the necessary machines on the network.
    In some areas, bandwidth may be limited. Once this limited bandwidth is exceeded,
    people in that area cannot participate in the network.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More nodes also leads to more latency, as the number of peer-to-peer communications
    increases as each peer propagates messages across the network. While peer-to-peer
    communication is very efficient for this purpose, it can still lead to lagging,
    and limit maximum throughput.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many blockchains require that participating nodes store the entire blockchain
    on the local hard drive. Both the storage requirement and the extremely long amount
    of time it takes to download the chain from the network act as barriers to participation,
    especially in areas with less consistent networks. For instance, the Ethereum
    blockchain is now over 400 GB in size. Without compression, this would be too
    big for the majority of personal laptops and many older desktop computers to store
    without requiring a dedicated machine to be used just for operating the blockchain.

- en: There have been a few attempts at increasing the performance of blockchain systems.
    Most of these involve some level of reduced decentralization. For instance, the
    Bitshares-derived set of systems uses a restricted set of full nodes called **witnesses**,
    of which there are only 21\. Only these computers are used to process and approve
    transactions; other machines on the network merely submit transactions to the
    network or observe. As well as many other performance optimizations made by the
    Bitshares team, they claim a theoretical throughput of up to 100,000 transactions
    a second. This leads to a second issue with blockchains, which is the cost compared
    to traditional approaches.

- en: While the Bitshares team suggests a theoretical limit of 100,000 transactions
    a second, they are using technologies and lessons from the LMAX exchange, which
    claims to be able to process over 6 million transactions a second. Most blockchains
    do not achieve a performance that is anywhere near the theoretical performance,
    with most blockchains achieving well under 1,000 transactions a second in practice.
    For instance, Bitcoin achieves approximately seven transactions a second, and
    Ethereum around 14\. A decent server running MySQL can process 10,000â€“20,000 transactions
    a second of similar complexity. Thus, traditional approaches are much easier to
    scale to larger transaction volumes than blockchain systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cost per performance of traditional database systems, including distributed
    database systems, is vastly cheaper on every level than blockchain systems. For
    any business, hiring experienced personnel for these systems is cheaper, easier,
    and less risky because they are so much better known and documented. Businesses
    considering blockchain must ask if a blockchain-based system provides a must-have
    feature in some way, because if not, other approaches are cheaper, easier, faster,
    or all of the preceding.

    scaling requirements and cost models when using blockchain. In time, costs and
    performance may improve, but there are no guarantees that they will improve fast
    enough if current approaches aren't sufficient.

    other systems. For instance, the use of any Ethereum-based DApp requires either
    the installation of a special browser or the MetaMask plugin for Chrome, or the
    purchase and transfer of Ethereum on one of the public markets and then learning
    the interface of the desired application. Each action taken requires the expenditure
    of Ethereum, the exact amount not necessarily known in advance and varying depending
    on network load.

    but prone to mistakes in the addresses. It is not easy for a human to know whether
    they are sending the value to `0x36F9050bb22d0D0d1BE34df787D476577563C4fC` or
    `0xF973EE1Bcc92d924Af3Fc4f2ce4616C73b58e5Cc`. Indeed, ICOs have been hacked by
    attackers gaining access to the ICO main website and simply changing the destination
    address, thereby siphoning away millions.

- en: When blockchain networks get hacked, users typically have no recourse. This
    is true whether or not the user is at fault in any way. When centralized exchanges
    have been hacked, one of the responses is *th*e users should not have trusted
    a centralized authority. However, with events such as the parity wallet hack and
    the DAO, users could lose access to their funds even when they did not trust a
    centralized authority. While one response could be they should have chosen a better
    wallet or project, it is unclear how users can realistically be expected to do
    that. For any Parity wallet hack, the Parity team involves some of the most renowned
    developers of the Ethereum world. The more likely response to such continued issues
    is to not use blockchain. To achieve mainstream acceptance, blockchain systems
    will need to be easier to use and provide some sort of advanced protection in
    the case of attacks, hacks, and other losses.

- en: All blockchains can suffer from consensus attacks, often referred to as 51%
    attacks because of the original consensus attack possible in Bitcoin. Every blockchain
    relies on the majority of its users or stakeholders being good actors, or at least
    not coordinating against the rest of the network. If the majority (or even a large
    minority) of the powerful network actors in a blockchain system coordinate against
    the rest, they will be able to launch double-spend attacks and extract large amounts
    of value from the network against its will.

    attacks against different blockchains, such as Verge (find the link in the references).
    In systems that are more centralized, such as proof-of-stake systems where there
    may be a small number of extremely large stakeholders, it is entirely possible
    that similar coordination''s could occur with something as simple as a few phone
    calls if concerned stakeholders have sufficient incentives. Such incentives do
    not necessarily need to be economic or on-chain at all: Politics or international
    relations could cause a set of patriotic stakeholders to collude for or against
    other users. For instance, a large amount of mining hardware and network gear
    originates in China, as does a lot of blockchain development. If the Chinese stakeholders
    discovered that they held a majority stake during an international fight with
    a regional rival, these stakeholders might be able to use their network power
    to punish network users that belong to the rival region, unilaterally.'

    has been forked twice, splitting into Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash, then again into
    Bitcoin Gold. There are now three independent networks claiming the Bitcoin mantle.
    While the original network is still by far the most dominant, all the forks were
    a result of a breakdown in agreement among the key network participants about
    the future of the technology.

    over how to respond to the DAO hack. The majority felt that the DAO should have
    the hacked funds restored, but a strong minority disagreed, asking why should
    this hack get special treatment over others?. The result was two networks, one
    with the hacked funds restored (Ethereum) and one where the network protocol was
    the rule no matter what (Ethereum Classic).

    The downside of an immutable ledger is that nothing can be hidden or alteredâ€”including
    bugs. In the case where networks such as Ethereum write the smart contract code
    into the chain itself, this means that code bugs cannot be fixed easily; the original
    code will remain on the blockchain forever. The only workaround is the modular
    code where each section references some other section, and these pointers have
    programmatic ways of being updated. This allows the authors of a DApp to upload
    a new piece of code and adjust the pointers appropriately. However, this method
    too has issues. Making these updates requires a specific authority to update the
    code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having a central authority that is necessary for updates just creates new problems.
    Either that authority has centralized control over the decentralized app (which
    means it is no longer decentralized) or a governing system must be written onto
    the blockchain as well. Both these options have security trade-offs. A centralized
    authority might be hacked or have their private keys stolen, resulting in a catastrophic
    loss to the system. A decentralized governing system requires substantially more
    code, and is itself at risk of a hack, with the DAO hack being exactly such an
    event.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Current blockchain technologies do not easily interoperate. While it is possible
    to write an application that can communicate with multiple blockchains, those
    blockchains do not have the natural capability to communicate with each other.
    In many cases, the fundamental approach to transactions and governance may not
    be compatible. For instance, in the Ethereum network, any user can send any token
    to any other user, no permission required by the recipient. The recipient is free
    to ignore the new tokens if they wish, but they still have them (which results
    in some interesting tax questions). In the Stellar network, however, a user must
    issue a trustline to another in order to receive custom tokens issued by that
    user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, many networks offer multisignature and multiuser wallets on-chain.
    However, without a centralized application sitting outside the blockchains themselves,
    there is no way for users to easily manage all of these networks in one place.
    This is part of the appeal of centralized exchanges to begin withâ€”no matter what
    the underlying protocol is, users get a predictable, universal interface that
    is able to send and receive tokens without regard for the underlying technology.

    In the case of blockchain, this natural order is made far worse because of the
    large and growing number of systems. Looking only at the major chains, systems
    are written in C, C++, Java, Scala, Golang, and Python. All of these systems have
    different architectures and protocols. The blockchains that have smart contracts
    have different contract models, contract APIs, and even completely different programming
    languages, such as Solidity and Serpent.

    models and challenges. The simpler the system, the easier those requirements are,
    but the less the blockchain will be able to do. Moreover, because of the recent
    surge of interest, blockchain skills are very expensive on the open market. In
    particular, top talentÂ with a proven track record is very hard to find.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the supposed advantages of blockchains is that they can be run anonymously.
    However, if this anonymity is ever broken, the immutable ledger means that every
    transaction throughout time can now be traced perfectly. Maintaining perfect anonymity
    is extremely hard, and even if one person is successful, if the people they do
    business with are not also anonymous as well, then statistical techniques can
    be used to narrow down the possibilities of their identity considerably.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While many people think about anonymity in terms of avoiding law enforcement
    or taxation, it is not only governments that might be interested in this information.
    For instance, plenty of criminal organizations would love to be able to identify
    wealthy but unassuming people. An organization could trace large holdings or transactions
    of cryptoassets to a specific person and use that as a targeting method for kidnapping
    or extortion. Add the immutability of cryptotransactions and this could make such
    attacks very attractive.

    an exaggeration, but even so, it illustrates the tremendous cost of running these
