    understanding of what blockchain technology is, how it works, and its applications
    and use cases. Perhaps you are excited about the disruptive potential of this
    new technology with all its incredible advantages. Ready for this brave new decentralized
    blockchain world? Well, not so fast, we are not quite there yet. There are some
    critical issues that need to be resolved first. In this chapter, we will be addressing
    those issues and finding potential solutions to them.

    versus centralized systems in the important aspects of scalability and governance.
    Running consensus among all nodes on the network just takes too much time and
    energy. Contrast this with a network with just one central server. Surely it will
    run faster? But we have already discussed the disadvantage of the central server
    model: it has a central point of failure. Therefore, there is a trade-off between
    scalability and speed on one hand, and security on the other hand.'

    is the Proof-of-Work global consensus mechanism. Their current architectures would
    need some modifications in order to scale to mass-adopted general-purpose technologies.
    Of course, protocol improvement proposals are being submitted constantly by the
    global community of developers and the core development teams are busy working
    on upgrades. But the technical complexity is only one side of the issue. Another
    side is political, and here is where the governance issue comes into play.

    consensus on the future development of a project. Moreover, the relationships
    between various participants are quite complex. Blockchain networks are not corporations
    where the separation of ownership, power, and control, among shareholders, management
    board, and other stakeholders, are clear. At least in this early stage, the governance
    lines in the blockchain community are pretty blurred. The list of important stakeholders
    includes founding teams, foundations, or other formal governing bodies, developers,
    miners, and cryptoasset holders. All these stakeholders jointly contribute to
    the value of the network. To that end, they form an ecosystem, in which each stakeholder
    group needs the other groups and they all benefit from their mutual involvement
    in the system.

    the block size limit and implementation of a technology called segregated witness,
    both for the sake of scalability improvement. During that debate, a huge divide

    must be preserved at all cost and sensitive information can be shared only with
    regulators on a need-to-know basis. Similarly, many corporations interested in
    deploying blockchain technology in their internal processes probably wouldn't
    like their business secrets to be recorded on a transparent and immutable public
    ledger. The same goes for the private financial dealings of many high-profile
    or high-net-worth individuals. Privacy is highly valued in the internet age and
    blockchains must be able to provide this option to users if they are to achieve

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do we mean exactly by scaling in the context of blockchains? A core security
    feature, but also a capacity limitation, of public blockchains such as Bitcoin
    and Ethereum is that their protocols require every transaction to be processed
    by every single full node in the network. Every operation that takes place on
    the blockchain, such as a payment or a deployment of a smart contract, must be
    replicated by all full nodes. This is what makes public blockchains secure, autonomous,
    and decentralized at the same time. Participants don't have to rely on someone
    else to tell them what the current state of the blockchain is; they figure it
    out for themselves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This puts a constraint on a blockchain's transaction throughput. It cannot be
    higher than the processing capacity of individual nodes, some of which may be
    quite limited. For example, some nodes may use less powerful computers, such as
    consumer devices. However, they are still very important to keep the network as
    decentralized as possible. We don't want all mining to be concentrated in large
    industrial-scale mining facilities, which would reduce decentralization and hence
    diminish the core value proposition of blockchain. This would make it resemble
    the current state of the internet, which is basically an oligopoly dominated by
    tech giants such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, or the current shape of the
    financial sector, an oligopoly dominated by huge multinational banking groups.

    upgrade it to allow for faster commuting by vehicles between two cities. Perhaps
    this speedway passes through a picturesque natural landscape with mountains, lakes,
    and rivers. The road may be a bit narrow and its pavement may be a little rough
    and uneven, so it doesn't allow for very high speed. The road may also not follow
    a straight line between the two cities and have a lot of turns, uphill, and downhill
    sections in order to go around lakes or Climb Mountains. Now, there are two main
    approaches to upgrade this road to allow for faster travel and higher throughput
    of vehicles. We can either make it wider or improve the quality of its pavement,
    or we can build additional infrastructure, such as tunnels and bridges, to enable
    quick passage through mountains, lakes, and rivers. Or, we can do both, as all
    these solutions are complementary to each other.

    support. And there is a big difference between what is suitable for an open permission-less
    public blockchain, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a private permissioned blockchain
    framework such as Hyperledger. The difference stems from the need for trust in
    the system, or lack thereof. Different levels of trust call for different consensus
    algorithms. Therefore Proof-of-Work is suitable for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but
    Proof-of-Elapsed Time is not. On the other hand, Proof-of-Elapsed Time is a great
    solution for the Hyperledger framework for permissioned blockchains.

    In fact, Ethereum's vision since inception has been to move to Proof-of-Stake,
    and this is expected to be implemented with the Casper upgrade.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Proof-of-Stake leverages a game theory principle of staking resources in order
    to mine new blocks, and this logic is similar to Proof-of-Work. The main difference
    is that while in Proof-of-Work miner's stake external resources, such as electricity
    and computer hardware, in Proof-of-Stake they pledge internal resources represented
    by their stake in the network's native cryptoasset. Thus, in the case of Ethereum,
    mining nodes would need to stake their Ether cryptocurrency in order to validate
    new transaction blocks. If they don't follow the rules of the protocol, miners
    would lose their security deposit of cryptoassets. This form of collateral should
    provide sufficiently strong incentives for miners to act with integrity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The potential benefits of Proof-of-Stake versus Proof-of-Work are many. It doesn't
    consume enormous amounts of electricity, and therefore it is much more sustainable
    and environmentally friendly. It also should provide a higher transaction throughput
    as network consensus can be reached faster, perhaps almost immediately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work can also be combined in hybrid consensus algorithms.
    For example, the Proof-of-Work hash puzzle can be made easier for miners with
    larger stake in the native cryptoasset or who have been holding their stake for
    longer.

    roadmap towards transition to Proof-of-Stake. In stage 1 of the Ethereum Casper
    upgrade, all of the Proof-of-Work mechanics continue to exist, but additional
    Proof-of-Stake mechanics are added. In this implementation, 1 out of every 100
    blocks is a checkpoint validated with Proof-of-Stake consensus. Participants who
    wish to be Proof-of-Stake validators can deposit their Ether cryptocurrency at
    a special smart contract address: a Casper contract. This address will provide
    them with a special validation code, which is a kind of a cryptographic key. The
    idea is similar to the keys used to sign and send transactions that we discussed
    in [Chapter 5](84ad3021-fae1-4e16-aaae-cee34e5d2bf6.xhtml), *Five Forces of Bitcoin
    – #2 Cryptography*.'

    they vote and participate in the Proof-of-Stake consensus process. For a new transaction
    block to be approved for inclusion in the blockchain, at least two-thirds of the
    active validator pool has to commit to it. If a situation arises in which two
    incompatible blocks with conflicting sets of transactions are mined at the same
    time, the miners responsible for that lose their deposits, which represents a
    huge incentive to act in good faith. The cost of attacking the Proof-of-Stake
    consensus mechanism could potentially be even higher than buying a lot of expensive
    computer hardware for mining and engaging in repeated attacks on a Proof-of-Work
    consensus system. In Proof-of-Stake, validators also get mining rewards in the
    form of transaction fees. This effectively delivers a stable yield on the stake
    they have deposited. It is similar to the interest rate people get from a bond
    or a bank deposit. This **return on investment** (or **ROI**) is also similar
    to the way Proof-of-Work miners get block rewards when they mine new blocks, to
    compensate them for their investment in physical hardware and electricity. For
    a detailed description of this process, please check out [Chapter 6](e7fab0bd-e3c6-45d3-9c59-147010110267.xhtml),

    in turn, can have its own child sub-chains. This architecture enables many complex
    operations to be done by smart contracts only at the child chain level, with minimal
    interaction with the Ethereum mainnet. In this way, the scaling of entire decentralized
    applications can be managed. With Plasma, we can avoid the replication of every
    single smart contract operation across all full nodes on the Ethereum network.
    This solution would spread around the workload of transaction processing and make
    the Ethereum network much lighter and more efficient. The plasma architecture
    is shown in the following diagram:'

    verification solution for blockchains* published in November 2017 by Jason Teutsch
    and Christian Reitwießner. It is designed to facilitate very complex calculations
    on the Ethereum blockchain. This is different to increasing transaction throughput,
    which scaling solutions such as state channels and Plasma aim to resolve.

- en: To understand the use case of Truebit, we need to keep in mind that computations
    performed on the main Ethereum blockchain are costly. Again, this is because they
    are processed by all full nodes on the network at the same time. To compensate
    miners for their computational work, Ethereum has a reward mechanism called gas
    cost, which is essentially transaction fees paid by the users who call transactions.
    Moreover, each Ethereum block has a maximum gas limit that sets a cap on how much
    total computation can be done by all transactions in a block. Therefore, some
    tasks that are too computationally intensive cannot be included in a block, even
    if they were the only transaction in that block.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, a smart contract running on Ethereum may need to verify that a
    transaction has been done on another blockchain, such as Bitcoin. This may be
    necessary for some applications that want to connect the two blockchains. Such
    verification could be a too big computational task to be performed on the Ethereum
    mainnet. In this case, Truebit can help. It essentially outsources the work on
    performing the verification to a third party. To guarantee that such third parties
    act in good faith, they are required to lock in a deposit in an Ethereum smart
    contract, which would be foregone if their job is not done properly. We can call
    this party a **Solver**. To enforce correct operation, the scheme makes use also
    of another third party, which checks the work performed by the first one, and
    has monetary incentives to do this properly. We can call this party a **Challenger**.
    In case there is a difference between the results obtained by the Solver and the
    Challenger, they are required to identify the exact operation that causes the
    disagreement. This should narrow down the computational work to a small task that
    can be performed on the Ethereum mainnet, and that would clearly show where the
    truth is, and which one is the correct result.

    main blockchain, for the sake of security. Small value transactions may be better

    also compatible with Ethereum, as they use the same programming language, Solidity,
    and are compatible with the **Ethereum virtual machine** (**EVM**). So, this can
    provide a level of interoperability between the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

    a privacy layer for Ethereum, which could greatly enhance its functionality. For

    require privacy. Anonymous Ethereum tokens can have many other applications as
    well.

    to address the issue. In this way, transaction validation rules can be decoupled
    from network protocol rules, for example, and each dimension can evolve separately.
