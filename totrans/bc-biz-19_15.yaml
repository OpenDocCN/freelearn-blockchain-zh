    versus centralized systems in the important aspects of scalability and governance.
    Running consensus among all nodes on the network just takes too much time and
    energy. Contrast this with a network with just one central server. Surely it will
    run faster? But we have already discussed the disadvantage of the central server
    model: it has a central point of failure. Therefore, there is a trade-off between
    scalability and speed on one hand, and security on the other hand.'

    where the separation of ownership, power, and control, among shareholders, management
    board, and other stakeholders, are clear. At least in this early stage, the governance
    lines in the blockchain community are pretty blurred. The list of important stakeholders
    includes founding teams, foundations, or other formal governing bodies, developers,
    miners, and cryptoasset holders. All these stakeholders jointly contribute to
    the value of the network. To that end, they form an ecosystem, in which each stakeholder

    regulators on a need-to-know basis. Similarly, many corporations interested in
    deploying blockchain technology in their internal processes probably wouldn't
    like their business secrets to be recorded on a transparent and immutable public
    ledger. The same goes for the private financial dealings of many high-profile

- en: What do we mean exactly by scaling in the context of blockchains? A core security
    feature, but also a capacity limitation, of public blockchains such as Bitcoin
    and Ethereum is that their protocols require every transaction to be processed
    by every single full node in the network. Every operation that takes place on
    the blockchain, such as a payment or a deployment of a smart contract, must be
    replicated by all full nodes. This is what makes public blockchains secure, autonomous,
    and decentralized at the same time. Participants don't have to rely on someone
    else to tell them what the current state of the blockchain is; they figure it
    out for themselves.

  zh: 在区块链的背景下，我们究竟是什么意思？公共区块链（如比特币和以太坊）的一个核心安全特性，同时也是容量限制，是其协议要求每个交易都由网络中的每个完整节点处理。区块链上发生的每个操作，例如付款或部署智能合约，都必须由所有完整节点复制。这就是使公共区块链同时安全、自治和分散的原因。参与者不必依赖别人告诉他们区块链的当前状态；他们自己弄清楚。
- en: This puts a constraint on a blockchain's transaction throughput. It cannot be
    higher than the processing capacity of individual nodes, some of which may be
    quite limited. For example, some nodes may use less powerful computers, such as
    consumer devices. However, they are still very important to keep the network as
    decentralized as possible. We don't want all mining to be concentrated in large
    industrial-scale mining facilities, which would reduce decentralization and hence
    diminish the core value proposition of blockchain. This would make it resemble
    the current state of the internet, which is basically an oligopoly dominated by
    tech giants such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, or the current shape of the
    financial sector, an oligopoly dominated by huge multinational banking groups.

    mining nodes would need to stake their Ether cryptocurrency in order to validate
    new transaction blocks. If they don't follow the rules of the protocol, miners

    performing the verification to a third party. To guarantee that such third parties
    act in good faith, they are required to lock in a deposit in an Ethereum smart
    contract, which would be foregone if their job is not done properly. We can call
    this party a **Solver**. To enforce correct operation, the scheme makes use also
    of another third party, which checks the work performed by the first one, and
    has monetary incentives to do this properly. We can call this party a **Challenger**.
    In case there is a difference between the results obtained by the Solver and the
    Challenger, they are required to identify the exact operation that causes the

- en: However, blockchain cryptoassets have the potential to gain global recognition
    as a new class of digital assets or commodities. They can have various functions
    such as medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value, similar to standard
    currencies or gold. They can power the economy similarly to the way oil, electricity,
    and internet bandwidth do. They can also enable distribution and trade of various
    economic resources and risks like company shares. Since they exhibit features
    of various established asset classes, perhaps they don't belong to any pre-existing
    category but should be considered a separate asset class of their own.

  zh: 然而，区块链加密资产有可能作为一类新型数字资产或商品全球范围内获得认可。 它们可以有各种功能，例如交换媒介、计价单位和价值存储，类似于标准货币或黄金。
    它们可以像石油、电力和互联网带宽一样推动经济。 它们还可以实现各种经济资源和风险的分配和交易，例如公司股份。 由于它们展现了各种已建立资产类别的特征，也许它们不属于任何现有类别，而应被视为一种独立的资产类别。
- en: Bitcoin futures contracts, a standard type of commodity trading contract, are
    already trading on major global exchanges such as the **Chicago Mercantile Exchange**
    (**CME**). Similar contracts are trading also on **Chicago Board Options Exchange** (**CBOE**)
    and are expected soon on NASDAQ. Bitcoin **Exchange Traded Funds** (**ETFs**),
    an established investment vehicle used for many assets and commodities, have also
    been in the pipeline for some time, and probably will be listed on the New York
    Stock Exchange at some point. These developments manifest the status Bitcoin is
    gaining globally as a form of digital gold. Perhaps other cryptoassets will follow
    suit, based on their further development and adoption. For example, Ether, the
    token giving access to distributed computational resources and storage on the
    Ethereum network, could be the next crypto-commodity traded in established financial
    venues around the world.

  zh: 比特币期货合约，一种标准的大宗商品交易合约，已经在像**芝加哥商品交易所**（**CME**）等主要全球交易所上交易。 类似的合约也在**芝加哥期权交易所**（**CBOE**）上交易，并很快预计将在纳斯达克上市。
    比特币**交易所交易基金**（**ETFs**），一种为许多资产和商品使用的成熟投资工具，也已经在路上一段时间，很可能会在某个时候在纽约证券交易所上市。 这些发展表明了比特币作为一种数字黄金正在全球范围内获得的地位。
    也许其他加密资产将效仿，并基于它们的进一步发展和采用在世界各地成立金融场所上交易。 例如，以太币，提供对以太坊网络上的分布式计算资源和存储设施的访问权的代币，可能是接下来在全球范围内已建立的金融场所上交易的下一个加密商品。

  zh: 区块链与Web 3.0
- en: We are currently at a stage where a new third generation of blockchain technology
    is emerging. Again, it builds upon the previous generations, most clearly manifested
    by Bitcoin and Ethereum. The key building blocks of modern blockchains, such as
    consensus algorithms, cryptography, data structures, network protocols, governance
    mechanisms, virtual machines, programming languages, and so on, are being tried
    and tested, modified and experimented with in the pursuit of the optimal solution.
    And perhaps there isn't even a single optimal solution and the future global economy
    will have a myriad of different blockchains fitting different purposes. Most new
    blockchain designs evolve towards more complex architecture with multiple layers
    and modules that facilitate scalability, interconnectivity, governance, and privacy.
    The trajectory of this trend resembles the way the internet evolved towards a
    universe of interconnected public and private networks, and now we have the public
    internet and millions of private intranets. We also have multiple blockchain applications
    focused on solving different problems in various sectors of the global economy
    and society. The main difference with the current internet is that Web 3.0 should
    be more decentralized, fair, and censorship-resistant.

  zh: 我们目前正处在新一代区块链技术的第三代新兴阶段。它再次构建在前几代的基础上，最明显地体现在比特币和以太坊上。现代区块链的关键构建模块，如共识算法、密码学、数据结构、网络协议、治理机制、虚拟机、编程语言等，正在不断尝试、测试、修改和实验，以寻求最佳解决方案。也许甚至不存在一个单一的最佳解决方案，未来全球经济将有无数不同的区块链，适用于不同的目的。大多数新的区块链设计朝着更复杂的架构演化，具有多层和模块，这些模块有助于可扩展性、互连性、治理和隐私。这种趋势的轨迹类似于互联网演变为相互连接的公共和私人网络的方式，现在我们有了公共互联网和数以百万计的私人内部网络。我们还有多个区块链应用程序，专注于解决全球经济和社会各个领域的不同问题。当前互联网的主要区别在于Web
    3.0应更加分散、公平和抗审查。

    and other organizations as we know them operate. The potential benefits for societies
    around the world are huge, from banking the billions of unbanked people to optimizing
    the performance of current industry leaders. All these improvements can not only
    create a lot of new economic value, but can also help distribute it in a better
    way, rewarding all participants in the ecosystem with their fair share.

- en: We hope you have enjoyed this amazing journey through the world of blockchain.
    Our mission with creating this book was to try and increase awareness and understanding
    of blockchain technology, and its useful applications, benefits, and challenges.
    This new distributed computing technology represents an exciting innovation, holds
    a lot of potential, and shouldn't be dismissed easily due to the boom and bust
    cycle of publicly traded cryptoassets. It is also impossible to cover everything
    going on there right now. Blockchain is at a very early stage, and at the same
    time is evolving so quickly that new, interesting technological and business developments
    come up almost every day. We believe that blockchain technology is here to stay
    and expect to see some new major breakthroughs soon.
