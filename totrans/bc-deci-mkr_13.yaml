    business technologies, mainly because they trigger a much cheaper and faster market
    entrance for new companies, hence strengthening competition. On the other hand,
    it is no secret that many businesses collapse due to their inadaptability to meet
    evolving demands, especially in the digital age. In the latest PwC CEO Survey
    ([https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2019/report/pwc-22nd-annual-global-ceo-survey.pdf](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2019/report/pwc-22nd-annual-global-ceo-survey.pdf)),
    28% of businesses have rated speed of technological change as an extremely concerning
    threat. Often, these traditional companies occult the fact that digitalization
    has quickly shifted the way products and services are consumed and struggle to
    leverage new technology to answer new consumption behaviors from clients and prospects.
    Blockchain is not going to make it easier for companies showing inertia on their
    path toward digitalization. Blockchain will not only contribute to changing consumption
    habits but it will also change how data flows and how value is transferred between
    economic actors, reshaping the capitalist economy in a more collaborative and
    transparent system where value is shared in a more horizontal manner. In this
    fashion, companies have a strong challenge ahead in developing a certain level
    of knowledge toward blockchain to avoid being sidelined in the coming years. But
    where can we start? In this chapter, we will approach a method to starting a blockchain
    project, address the risks and opportunities that have to be taken into consideration,
    the underlying and inevitable costs, and finally, the traps that must be avoided.

    is pointless because it does not answer the end user's need. I often compare this
    typical behavior as grabbing a screwdriver and checking what can be fixed with
    it. Sure, some stuff might be repaired along the way, but the main problem would
    not have been fixed. Hence, it is important to identify the problem first, before

    project with a business case, which is the first requirement in any IT project.
    The business case should include a variety of issues, such as how regulatory constraints
    are addressed, how many resources are needed, which standards should be used and
    implemented and, of course, what needs does the final product or service answer
    to. A way to push the assessment further is to analyze the firm's acceptance level
    of change and the risk tolerance level. Based on these outputs, it will become
    easier to determine a rational **return on investment** (**ROI**) to decide whether
    to invest. By identifying the potential gain according to the risk-reward premise,
    you will be able to thoroughly establish a strategic approach for your project
    and, more broadly, for your company.

    are aligned and that strong governance is in place, that is defining the roles
    and responsibilities of everyone in the network so that you can properly design
    the infrastructure. A blockchain's success mostly lies in the nodes' independency.
    One node should be sovereign over its decision to validate transaction and information
    storage; that is why governance is a real issue when it comes to blockchain. Do
    not forget that this is the network that empowers the blockchain; hence, this
    is probably the most important component to deal with.

    of the infrastructure. The proof-of-concept phase is very important because the
    technology is evolving at a rapid pace and a concrete demonstration is very useful
    for picturing the product and quantify the benefits. Evolving as an agile enterprise
    with continuous improvement and incremental releases is key to adapting to customers'
    needs. In the meantime, the enterprise should put in place the necessary organizational
    frameworks, including working groups and communication processes, so that development,
    integration, production, and adoption are sufficiently supported. Eventually,
    taking care of finance, marketing, and commerce will become mandatory if we want
    to be able to deliver the project as well as being assured that sufficient economic
    and technological support is provided.

    project varies a lot. Depending on what you are willing to achieve, the use of
    a certain infrastructure over another will range the investments from small to
    large. For example, the cost of authenticating official documents through a public
    blockchain will mostly comprise the transaction fees levied by the network to
    process the transactions, which is not a very expensive blockchain application.
    Using a public blockchain is sometimes the cheapest solution if we wish to benefit
    from an already existing infrastructure. Besides the transaction fees, the costs
    will mostly rely on developing the application on top of it and focusing on user
    experience.

    Facebook is doing with their Libra Project where they create a permissioned blockchain
    integrating smart contracts based on a new programming language, it might involve
    a greater deal of money. What will mostly make the total cost vary is the size
    of the network powering the infrastructure and how many users will be exploiting
    the service. Scaling up a permissioned blockchain to an inter-enterprise level
    can become very expensive.

    these services to external companies whose prices are much lower, although distance
    can become a negative factor for the execution of the project. This downside can
    be, however, offset by eliminating a difficult task from the roadmap: building
    a multi-skill profiles team with R&D researchers, data analysts, business analysts,

    example) the development costs can shrink quickly while subscription and maintenance
    fees heighten. For a first blockchain project, these solutions sound more appropriate
    because it provides flexibility and more room for manoeuvring when iterating on
    the final product or service. As I stated previously, attention is required for
    cloud-based solutions; however, the degree of decentralization can be reduced
    to zero for some providers offering solutions that are hosted on their own servers.
    This kind of infrastructure actually eliminates the prime interest in implementing
    a blockchain because it creates a single point of failure and erases the nodes'
    independency.

    blockchain, the more blockchain platforms are emerging and the less likely that
    one actor emerges from the crowd. Despite growing live product and media coverage,
    no one can tell which infrastructure is going to thrive between public and permissioned

    democratize the project and spread the word), and communication plans. Additional

    achieving a strong market study, as well as selecting a proper IT infrastructure.
    This goes along with assessing the level of *competition* of the network, that
    is, assessing how sensitive the data is and the value that will be shared between
    the stakeholders who are likely to provide someone with a competitive advantage.

    with others in a trustless environment and should not provide a competitive advantage

    Even though most of the solutions out there are open source and allow enablers
    to help you quickly understand mining and smart contracts, for example, there
    are inevitable steps along the way. Adopting a wider approach, the first step
    would be to choose the platform. Note that Ethereum generally makes unanimity
    and has been chosen by many companies for their project because of its dynamism
    and its large supporting community and rich documentation. Once the platform has
    been chosen, you have to initialize the blockchain, that is, create nodes and
    trigger the first block, including the choice of data velocity, transaction timespan,
    and the size of the blocks. This step can be outsourced to service providers who
    will take care of setup and configuration. Eventually, the choice of the consensus
    protocol rises and will depend on whether your project includes a certain degree
    of confidentiality and restrictions (in other words, a private network) or if
    you have chosen a public blockchain. As we mentioned previously, the use of proof-of-work
    within private networks is irrelevant because the nodes are identified and they
    do not need to compete based on computational power. As a last step, you must
    deploy your applications and smart contracts, remaining careful of the programming
    language that was used to develop them after having checked whether it is handled
    by the service provider. Do not forget that the application itself is why you
    wrote a business case and chose blockchain in the first place. Needless to say,
    your final product must convenience end users; otherwise, why choose blockchain?

    led the advancement of the technology in the first place. Criticism started to
    rise as blockchain was gaining popularity. Starting from 2017, blockchain underwent
    massive media coverage due to the rise in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

    mentioned as one of the six mega-trends that would contribute to the transition
    to a more digital and connected world. The report asserting this estimation was
    based on a survey of more than 800 IT executives and experts and was conducted
    by the Global Agenda Council on the Future of Software and Society. It was estimated
    that, by 2027, 10% of the global GDP will be stored on blockchain ([http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC15_Technological_Tipping_Points_report_2015.pdf](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC15_Technological_Tipping_Points_report_2015.pdf)) and
    will have important impacts on financial inclusion in emerging markets, tradable
    assets, property records, and exchangeable services and value. This was a very
    bold prediction at the time, by Victoria Espinel, president and CEO of the Business
    Software Alliance, a trade group representing the world's largest software makers,
    such as Kaspersky Lab and whose mission is to prevent copyright infringement of
    software. There's no doubt that her report was very clairvoyant as she added a
    conclusion that, if blockchain came to be widely adopted, governments would need
    to rethink their traditional mode of operation and the way they function.

    year at the same event. Invited to Davos, the US Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew
    expressed his incredulity toward Bitcoin, declaring that he was making sure that
    it will not be used to finance illegal activities that have malign purposes. This
    declaration was a blatant confession of his misunderstanding of Bitcoin and blockchain.
    In fact, the decentralized infrastructure of Bitcoin prevents any authority from
    taking over the network and controlling the way value is transferred between individuals.
    Unfortunately, because of that, Bitcoin has been used as a means to purchase illicit
    products, but that was mainly true until the online global drug bazaar, Silk Road,
    was shut down ([https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/)).

    a leading actor in the crypto-sphere and has launched its own tokens, JPM Coin,
    and its own blockchain infrastructure, Quorum. This stark turnaround happened
    less than two years after Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a fraud and threatened to
    fire any analyst that was trading it. This is a quite intriguing behavior to say

    have had their voice heard. One of the most well-known is probably Don Tapscott.
    This Canadian business executive and consultant dedicated his life to supporting
    companies and their business strategies and the role of technology in their growth
    path. In 2017, Tapscott founded the Blockchain Research Institute, a renowned
    independent global think-tank currently helping more than a hundred projects study
    the implications of blockchain on businesses, governments, and society. According
    to Tapscott, blockchain should not be compared to any other new technologies such
    as AI, big data, or the **Internet of Things** (**IoT**) but rather as the trigger
    initiating the fourth industrial revolution, the layer that will allow all-new
    technologies to transact autonomously in an entirely digital world.

    was not appropriate because the solution didn't involve criteria that was mandatory
    when choosing blockchain, such as the need to store information or the alignment
    of participants' interests. But when blockchain stands as a suitable solution,
    many diverse assessments, requirements, and topics must be addressed. Among them
    is the return on investment, the regulatory constraints, or the acceptance level
    of the teams to change. Besides these open points, we tried to answer a difficult
    but necessary question regarding the cost of a blockchain, which, in the end,
    can be considered a regular IT project including specific features, especially
    when it comes to launching an ICO. Then, we discussed challenges and issues that
    must be taken into consideration, such as the consensus protocol, the degree of
    competition in the network, and data management. Eventually, we illustrated some

    like big data, artificial intelligence or Internet-of-Things should be considered
    as an enabler and not as a goal. This book demonstrated all the keys for a decision
    maker or any curious business person to grasp this new technology, to understand
    its application and all the stakes gravitating around it. It was reinforced that
    blockchain was not a solution to every business issue, but rather an emerging
    computing infrastructure enabling digital value to be exchanged in a peer-to-peer
    manner without any trusted third party. With that in mind, the extent of the disruption
    in the current economy system that blockchain could bring was illustrated. The

    are not judged by customers nor investors on how many digital solutions they have
    deployed, how much money they have spent to become digital-ready, or how responsive
    to change they are. Instead, a company is supposed to be able to answer specific
    business issues, reach specific business goals as well as cater to customers'
    needs in order to prosper in the digital age and keep growing profitably. As a

    First, a focus should be made on standardization, that is on simplifying and documenting
    processes. Standardization does not involve any digital solutions and is only
    the precise description of processes and stakeholders. Second, the pursuit of
    dematerialization through digitization of paper-based processes will put the organization
    ready for disruption. Third, industrialization that often comes along with dematerialization
    enables reaching a continuous pace of production through the implementation of
    methods within the processes. Last but not least, implementing innovative tools
    as a final layer (whether it is robots, algorithms or blockchain) will help you
    increase speed, lessen risks and increase reliability. This mindset should be
    embraced by every C-Level executive willing to implement a new technology in their
    organization, because it requires patience and a strong willingness to transform.
    Blockchain is no exception, especially regarding its newness and difficulty to
    apprehend.

    economic and legal challenges it embarks, how it is implemented and tackled by
    leading organizations, and how it could be deployed. I truly hope that you now
    have a better understanding of this emerging technology to the point that you have grasped
    enough aspects to form your own opinion of blockchain. I also hope that you developed
    enough interest to keep an eye on its future, and of course that you could go
    on to explain it to your teams, colleagues, relatives or friends. As a final takeaway, here
    is an elevator pitch of what a blockchain is:'
