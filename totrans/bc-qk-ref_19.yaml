    **initial token offering**. An ICO is an event where a new blockchain project
    raises money by offering network tokens to potential buyers. Unlike IPOs, no equity
    is for sale. Buyers receive tokens on the network but do not own the underlying
    project intellectual property, legal ownership, or other traditional equity traits
    unless specifically promised as part of the sale. The expectation of profit (if
    there is one) comes from holding the token itself. If demand for use of the new
    network increases, then presumably so will the value of owning the token.'

    token, such as bitcoin, would increase in value and at least a few others agreed.
    Mastercoin held a month-long fundraiser and ended up raising about $500,000, while
    afterwards the Mastercoin overall market cap appreciated to as high as $50 million.
    The ability to raise substantial capital without going through traditional channels

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Private placement is the art of selling large blocks of tokens to private investors,
    usually before those tokens are available on the common market. There are a number
    of reasons for this practice. First, private investors tend to be more sophisticated
    and are able to place large buys. The literal buy-in of a well-established investor,
    especially one with a successful track record, will encourage future buying as
    the highest risk purchase is the first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Private buyers also provide early funds, possibly before the whitepaper is finalized
    if they really believe in the strength of the team. In addition, accredited larger
    investors also have a special legal status in many jurisdictions, including in
    the United States. This status makes it much safer to sell to them in the uncertain
    legal environment that faces ICOs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the founders do not have an extensive network, they will need to build one
    as best they can. This can be done by going to conferences, giving talks, attending
    meetups, and building genuine relationships. This process can take a long time,
    and founders are encouraged to begin this activity immediately. Networking such
    as this should happen if you are even considering a blockchain startup or ICO,
    even before the company is founded. It's also important that a genuine relationship
    is formed—once these people buy in, they are essentially partners. Their success
    is the company's success, so they will be highly motivated to help promote the
    company. At the same time, the company's failure is their failure and loss, so
    they will want to have a strong trust in the abilities of the founders. Relationships
    such as this are rarely made instantly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One step removed from this process is finding the right advisors. Advisors who
    have access to investors will absolutely wish to be paid for their services, often
    up front and with a percentage of the raise. Too many people want access to investors
    to be worth bothering with anyone with no resources at all. Moreover, these advisors
    must also believe in the project. For an advisor to bring investors bad projects
    is to lose access to that investor and sour their relationship. Responsible advisors
    will, therefore, refuse to introduce projects until those projects are truly ready
    for investment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last way for private sales to happen is for a project to get enough interest
    publicly that investors seek out the project. Because project hype corresponds
    strongly to token prices, buying into a token with a lot of hype and PR is seen
    as a safer investment. Smart investors will still strongly vet the project and
    team, but this evidence of early traction makes things much easier.

    spent substantial time in community building, early fundraising, PR activities
    (see in the succeeding sections), and so on. The reason for all this is that the
    most successful ICOs tend to be over very fast, selling out in minutes or hours.
    There are three major different approaches to structuring the sale.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The capped sale is the most common ICO structure. In a capped sale, there is
    typically a soft cap and a hard cap. The soft cap is the minimum raise the team
    is looking for to build their project. The hard cap is the maximum they will accept
    as part of the raise. Once the token sale begins, it is usually executed on a
    first come, fist served basis. Tokens are sold at a pre-set rate. In some cases,
    that rate may include bonuses. For example, the first 20 buyers (or first $20,000) receives
    a 10% bonus in terms of the number of tokens purchased. As the sale continues,
    the bonus drops. This structure is designed to reward initial movers and inspire
    fomo for fear of missing out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Uncapped sale
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The uncapped sale is designed to raise as much capital as possible. This is
    done by fixing the time of the sale and, typically, the number of tokens available.
    As people buy in, they receive a share of tokens equal to their share of the total
    capital invested. The number of tokens each person receives is often not known
    until the end of the ICO. For instance, if, on day 1 an investor puts in $10,000
    and no one else bids, they would own all of the available tokens. However, the
    next day, another investor puts in $10,000 as well. If this were the end of the
    sale, the two investors would each own half the available tokens.

    A Dutch auction works with the auction beginning with a high price, with the price
    slowly lowered until participants jump in or a reserve is hit. A reverse Dutch
    auction starts with a low price, and the price is then slowly raised over time
    at fixed intervals. Either approach is good for finding a proper market price
    for a token, provided that there are a sufficient number of buyers. The most famous
    ICO to use the Dutch auction approach was the Gnosis project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Instead, the number of tokens released would increase the longer the auction took
    to hit the cap of $9 million GNO tokens sold, or $12.5 million raised. Despite
    the auction setup designed to slow down participation, the sale was over in under
    15 minutes.

    aspects of ICO marketing, because few ICO teams already have the requisite media
    contacts. PR agencies can help, but tend to be expensive. Whether or not a PR
    agency is used, an ICO should have everything else carefully lined up first. Mainstream
    media attention will bring a lot of attention, which also means a lot more people
    looking for flaws. A well-executed whitepaper, solid website, a good and clear
    plan, and fantastic team bios are all important.

    blogs and platforms, such as Medium or Steemit, where there will be many casual

    investors wish to see some level of working prototype before they will buy into

    they are more likely to invest. Building relationships in person is one way to
    do that, and the easiest way for many projects to meet investors is through attending

    Francisco, or some other major technology hub, then they are far less likely to
    have access to a serious investor network. With ICOs, it is possible for anyone,
    anywhere, to attempt to attract early-stage investment. The downside, however,
    is that the level of due diligence and skill of those doing the investment is
    questionable and the amount of credible information is low.

- en: An ICO typically starts with the release of a whitepaper, a relatively short
    document going over the value of the network, the token, and future plans. Because
    the technology is new, and a typical ICO campaign is short (3-4 months), there
    is very little time and opportunity for investors to do extensive due diligence.
    Moreover, because blockchain based startups are not required to show financials
    (they don't have any), traction, or product-market fit (there is no product yet),
    there would be little data on which to base evaluations.

    is no real connection between blockchain tokens and company shares. Ownership
    of a blockchain token backed by a company provides no ownership, influence, or
    rights to the company's profits, behavior, or business in any way. The value of
    the token is instead driven entirely by the value of the network itself and what
    that network enables. Moreover, if a company creates a blockchain project and
    then abandons it, the token holders likely have no recourse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of this, the way tokens are released can have a huge effect on how a
    company supports a blockchain project. For instance, if a team were to sell 90%
    of network tokens in an ICO, then in the future, they will receive only 10% of
    the benefit of the rise in value of the token. In comparison, they may have millions
    of dollars in cash on hand. Because of this, the team may decide to give only
    a limited amount of attention to the blockchain project and feel little urgency
    in terms of having improve the network. A small team with tens of millions of
    dollars could pay themselves large salaries until they die and be very secure.

    defeat most of the purpose of blockchain technology, leading to the preceding
    issue—do they really need a blockchain to begin with?'

    a team of investors may be more incentivized to create hype for the network rather
    than substance. If a project can create enough buzz, the value of their token
    may increase tenfold. If the token is then liquid, team members and early investors
    could dump the token for a huge profit and then move on. No longer having anything
    at stake, the project might be abandoned.

    and team lockup, preventing team members and large investors from selling the
    token at all for a period of time followed, by a slow vesting where tokens are
    released over time. By preventing liquidity, the team must focus on long-term
    value versus short-term manipulation.

    a company offers a product and earns a return from sales. However, if you are
    also creating a currency from nothing and selling and trading it for some other
    product, or if this currency IS the product, then the situation is more complicated.
    If the sustainability of the project comes from selling currency, then a downturn
    can be catastrophic as currency buyers dry up and immense swings in the value
    of the network can take place nearly instantly. Just as was the case with failed

    no liquidity. With tokens, the sale can happen rapidly after the initial raise
    is finished. Many tokens would come onto the market mere months after the initial
