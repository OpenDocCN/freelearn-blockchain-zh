- en: '**ICO** stands for **Initial Coin Offering**, also called a **token sale** or
    **initial token offering**. An ICO is an event where a new blockchain project
    raises money by offering network tokens to potential buyers. Unlike IPOs, no equity
    is for sale. Buyers receive tokens on the network but do not own the underlying
    project intellectual property, legal ownership, or other traditional equity traits
    unless specifically promised as part of the sale. The expectation of profit (if
    there is one) comes from holding the token itself. If demand for use of the new
    network increases, then presumably so will the value of owning the token.'

    token, such as bitcoin, would increase in value and at least a few others agreed.
    Mastercoin held a month-long fundraiser and ended up raising about $500,000, while
    afterwards the Mastercoin overall market cap appreciated to as high as $50 million.

    teams that were relatively well known inside the blockchain community that spent
    considerable time and effort bringing a project to life before running the ICO.

    infrastructure from scratch. For more on how this is done, see the chapters on
    Solidity and Smart Contracts (See [Chapter 13](d3b6caa1-a5ed-4147-82dc-ea5074126df2.xhtml), *Solidity

  zh: 私募
- en: Private placement is the art of selling large blocks of tokens to private investors,
    usually before those tokens are available on the common market. There are a number
    of reasons for this practice. First, private investors tend to be more sophisticated
    and are able to place large buys. The literal buy-in of a well-established investor,
    especially one with a successful track record, will encourage future buying as
    the highest risk purchase is the first.

  zh: 私募是将大块代币出售给私人投资者的艺术，通常是在这些代币在公开市场上可用之前。这种做法有很多原因。首先，私人投资者往往更加复杂，能够进行大额购买。一个成功的、有成功记录的、知名投资者的真正参与，尤其是那些创业风险最高的购买，将会鼓励未来的购买。
- en: Private buyers also provide early funds, possibly before the whitepaper is finalized
    if they really believe in the strength of the team. In addition, accredited larger
    investors also have a special legal status in many jurisdictions, including in
    the United States. This status makes it much safer to sell to them in the uncertain
    legal environment that faces ICOs.

  zh: 项目在投资之前就已经产生了足够的关注和兴趣，以至于买家主动寻找它们
- en: If the founders do not have an extensive network, they will need to build one
    as best they can. This can be done by going to conferences, giving talks, attending
    meetups, and building genuine relationships. This process can take a long time,
    and founders are encouraged to begin this activity immediately. Networking such
    as this should happen if you are even considering a blockchain startup or ICO,
    even before the company is founded. It's also important that a genuine relationship
    is formed—once these people buy in, they are essentially partners. Their success
    is the company's success, so they will be highly motivated to help promote the
    company. At the same time, the company's failure is their failure and loss, so
    they will want to have a strong trust in the abilities of the founders. Relationships
    such as this are rarely made instantly.

  zh: 如果创始人没有广泛的人脉，他们需要尽可能地建立人脉。这可以通过参加会议、发表演讲、参加聚会和建立真正的人际关系来实现。这个过程可能需要很长时间，鼓励创始人立即开始这项活动。即使在公司成立之前，这样的人际关系也应该有所发展，如果你甚至考虑过区块链初创公司或ICO。同样重要的是建立真正的关系——一旦这些人投入，他们实际上就是合作伙伴。他们的成功就是公司的成功，所以他们将非常有动力地帮助推广公司。同时，公司的失败也是他们的失败和损失，所以他们希望对创始人的能力有很强的信任。这样的关系很少是一夜之间建立起来的。
- en: One step removed from this process is finding the right advisors. Advisors who
    have access to investors will absolutely wish to be paid for their services, often
    up front and with a percentage of the raise. Too many people want access to investors
    to be worth bothering with anyone with no resources at all. Moreover, these advisors
    must also believe in the project. For an advisor to bring investors bad projects
    is to lose access to that investor and sour their relationship. Responsible advisors
    will, therefore, refuse to introduce projects until those projects are truly ready
    for investment.

  zh: 进行这个过程的下一步是找到合适的顾问。拥有投资者资源的顾问希望得到报酬，通常是提前和筹集的一部分。太多人想要接触投资者，所以没资源的人没必要打扰。此外，这些顾问必须对项目有信心。顾问把投资人引入糟糕的项目会失去对该投资人的影响力，影响他们的关系。因此，负责任的顾问会拒绝引入项目，直到这些项目真正做好了投资准备。
- en: The last way for private sales to happen is for a project to get enough interest
    publicly that investors seek out the project. Because project hype corresponds
    strongly to token prices, buying into a token with a lot of hype and PR is seen
    as a safer investment. Smart investors will still strongly vet the project and
    team, but this evidence of early traction makes things much easier.

  zh: 私募销售发生的最后一种方式是项目在公开市场得到足够的关注，投资者主动寻求该项目。因为项目的炒作与代币价格强相关，所以购买高度炒作和公关的代币被认为是更安全的投资。聪明的投资者仍然会对项目和团队进行严格的审查，但这种早期的迹象使事情变得更容易。

- en: The capped sale is the most common ICO structure. In a capped sale, there is
    typically a soft cap and a hard cap. The soft cap is the minimum raise the team
    is looking for to build their project. The hard cap is the maximum they will accept
    as part of the raise. Once the token sale begins, it is usually executed on a
    first come, fist served basis. Tokens are sold at a pre-set rate. In some cases,
    that rate may include bonuses. For example, the first 20 buyers (or first $20,000) receives
    a 10% bonus in terms of the number of tokens purchased. As the sale continues,
    the bonus drops. This structure is designed to reward initial movers and inspire
    fomo for fear of missing out.

  zh: 定价销售是最常见的ICO结构。在定价销售中，通常设有软顶和硬顶。软顶是团队为建设项目寻求的最低筹资额。硬顶则是作为筹资的最大接受值。一旦代币销售开始，通常会按先到先得的原则执行。代币以预设的价格出售。在某些情况下，该价格可能包括奖金。例如，前20名购买者（或前$20,000）购买的代币数量将获得10%的奖金。随着销售的进行，奖金会下降。此结构旨在奖励初期行动者，并激发FOMO（害怕错过）。

- en: The uncapped sale is designed to raise as much capital as possible. This is
    done by fixing the time of the sale and, typically, the number of tokens available.
    As people buy in, they receive a share of tokens equal to their share of the total
    capital invested. The number of tokens each person receives is often not known
    until the end of the ICO. For instance, if, on day 1 an investor puts in $10,000
    and no one else bids, they would own all of the available tokens. However, the
    next day, another investor puts in $10,000 as well. If this were the end of the
    sale, the two investors would each own half the available tokens.

- en: Any machines used to run the website for an ICO should have some level of intrusion
    detection software installed as a backup. If, for some reason, something was missed,
    it's critical that the team be notified of any suspicious behavior on key servers.
    There are numerous intrusion detection products on the market. Key features to
    look for are modifications of permissions detection and file change detection
    (for instance, altering an HTML file to change the Ethereum address as to where
    to send funds).

- en: Another way ICOs can be attacked is through the purchase of similar sounding
    or looking domains. For instance, if a team is running on `myIcoDomain.io`, the
    attacker might buy `myIcoDomain.net`. It's important for teams to make this harder
    by buying as many related domains as they can, especially with the most common
    extensions. If an attacker owns one of these related domains, they can easily
    send emails to possible buyers, post messages on social media, and so on, in a
    way that may confuse some buyers. Just as with DNS attacks, attackers will often
    put up an identical looking site except for the critical payment details.

  zh: 通过购买听起来或看起来相似的域名，黑客还可以攻击ICO。例如，如果一个团队正在使用`myIcoDomain.io`，攻击者可能会购买`myIcoDomain.net`。
    团队应该尽可能购买尽可能多的相关域名，特别是最常见的扩展名。如果攻击者拥有这些相关域名中的一个，他们可以轻松地向潜在买家发送电子邮件，在社交媒体上发布消息等等，以一种可能会混淆一些买家的方式。
    就像DNS攻击一样，攻击者通常会建立一个外观一样的网站，除了关键的付款细节。

    and proactively warn users to mistrust anything else.

- en: Attackers also may try and steal funds by injecting messages into Facebook groups,
    telegram groups, discord channels, and other communication platforms to steal
    funds. For instance, a user may show up and declare that they are helping the
    team and could everyone please fill out some survey or other. The survey collects
    email addresses and, naturally, those email addresses are then sent emails that
    look as though they are coming from a related domain to send funds or get a special
    sale.

  zh: 攻击者还可以尝试通过向Facebook组，电报组，discord频道和其他通讯平台注入信息来窃取资金。例如，一个用户可能会出现并宣称他们正在帮助团队，所有人都可以填写一些调查或其他。
    调查收集电子邮件地址，自然地，然后这些电子邮件地址会收到看起来像来自相关域的电子邮件，以便发送资金或获得特别销售。

  zh: 多重签名钱包
- en: Funds collected by an ICO should be moved into a multi-signature wallet. This
    is because another possible attack is to compromise the wallet holding the funds,
    allowing the attacker to transfer everything to themselves. Multi-signature wallets
    exist for most major crypto ecosystems, and radically increase the difficulty
    for attackers. Instead of stealing the private key for one person, they must now
    steal multiple keys from multiple computers and use them all simultaneously. In
    the Ethereum ecosystem, the Gnosis wallet has proven robust and capable here,
    used by multiple successful teams without incident.

  zh: ICO募集的资金应该转移到多重签名钱包中。这是因为另一个可能的攻击是篡改持有资金的钱包，使攻击者可以将所有资金转移到自己名下。大多数主要加密生态系统都存在多重签名钱包，并且极大地增加了攻击者的难度。他们现在不再只需窃取一个人的私钥，而是必须同时窃取多台计算机上的多个密钥并将它们全部使用。在以太坊生态系统中，Gnosis钱包在这方面被证明是健壮而可靠的，已被多个成功团队使用而未发生事故。

    code helps to decrease the likelihood of a hack. By being proactive in looking
    for and removing vulnerabilities with the help of skilled third-parties, a team
    both increases trust in the project and decreases the chance that something has
    been missed that a hacker could exploit.

  zh: 结论
- en: By now, you should have a good idea of what goes into an ICO and some idea of
    the immense work that goes into it. A typical ICO can go for minutes to months,
    but it takes an incredible amount of prep work to get marketing materials done
    for public and private investors. Any ICO project should be extremely careful
    about security, as an ICO that gets hacked and loses funds will find it very hard
    to inspire confidence in the project and in future projects.

  zh: 到目前为止，您应该已经对ICO中涉及的内容有了一个很好的了解，并对其中所需的巨大工作有了一些了解。一个典型的ICO可能持续数分钟至数月，但为了为公众和私人投资者完成营销材料，需要做大量的准备工作。任何ICO项目都应该非常小心安全问题，因为一个被黑客攻击并且失去资金的ICO将很难激发对项目和未来项目的信心。
- en: Many ICOs fail, either because of a lack of marketing, the wrong team, or an
    inability to engage the community. The early days of easy money are over. Still,
    ICOs are, on average, vastly more successful than traditional approaches to gaining
    funds, such as approaching Venture Capitalists.
