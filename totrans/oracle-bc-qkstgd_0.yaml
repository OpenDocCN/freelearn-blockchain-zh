    business leaders; from blockchain enthusiast evangelists to designers, architects,
    and developers; and to anyone and everyone who wants to benefit from the experience
    offered in this book. This book is intended to become a quick reference guide
    to learn blockchain, HLF, design strategies, and build chaincode on a blockchain
    platform. This book adopts a model that will allow readers to refer to this book
    as a reference for blockchain, its use cases, Hyperledger, design strategy, and
    quick development on the blockchain platform.

- en: '[Chapter 1](759718e2-3861-41c1-8d90-bad1deeceddb.xhtml), *Exploring Blockchain
    and BaaS*, offers an in-depth exploration of blockchain and distributed ledger
    technology. It also takes you through blockchain-layered architecture, types of
    networks, actors, and structure. This chapter offers a prelude to blockchain,
    shows its relationship with distributed ledger technology, and demonstrates its
    pertinence to it. This chapter will demystify the prominence of the BaaS platform,
    its architecture, features, qualifiers, and the ease of use of prebuilt applications
    while exploring the eminence of OBP.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](66a7f3de-72ef-49e8-95fb-c65908888e2e.xhtml), *Construing Distributed
    Ledger Tech and Blockchain*, demonstrates the world of HLF design and implementation
    strategy, while diving into the comprehensive five-step design strategy—explore,
    engage, experiment, experience, and influence. In this chapter, we will build
    equations, coined by the author, to justify blockchain as the qualified solution
    for a given use case. We will look at various structures of permissioned business
    networks, such as joint venture, consortium, and founder initiated, and glance
    at a **permissioned distributed autonomous organization** (**pDAO**). We will
    also look at different types of use cases, ascertain the properties of blockchain,
    and witness them as the driving force behind various use cases and their adoption.
    The book includes a use case on FinTech; helping you to learn the art of modeling
    a blockchain business network (KonsensusChain) by defining its assets, participants,
    ledgers, consensus, transactions, events, permissions, and access controls. It
    also explores how to integrate a permissioned Hyperledger-based business network
    with BPM, SaaS, and other applications, while creating an infrastructure for the
    sample business network.'

- en: Chapter 3, *Delving into Hyperledger Fabric*, demonstrates Hyperledger's architecture
    and allows you to assemble a sample Hyperledger-based business network. You will
    look at a founder-based and a consortium-based business network. You will learn
    about business network components, adding peers to channels, working with chaincode,
    and smart contracts. It will guide you in enabling a dApp or application to transact
    with the business network. You will also take a deep dive into identity, security,
    privacy, membership services, and channels, as well as walking through ledger
    state and transaction flow via a PiggyBank example. These details will allow you
    to learn transaction flow and its steps, such as proposals, endorsement, packaging
    responses, verification, ordering, distribution, validation, committing, and notifications.
    Furthermore you'll see on-chain and off-chain architecture as an extension to
    a private data collection.

- en: Chapter 4, *Engage in Business Case on Blockchain Platform*, allows you to engage with
    OBP. You'll learn how to design a solution inline with the constructs of OBP.
    You'll also see the sample business network topology, network artifacts, and solution
    and deployment architecture. Furthermore, you'll explore OBP in detail, its features,
    and components. You'll also delve into defining and creating an instance of a
    founder-based business network. In the chapter, you will see a rich history database
    working with channels.

    the practicality of translating network topology on OBP, creating network stakeholders,
    and configuring OBP instances. This ledger of knowledge illustrates a transaction
    infrastructure setup, joining participants to a business network, access control,
    adding smartness (chaincode) to a business network, and REST proxy configuration
    to expose chaincode to a dApp.

- en: Chapter 6, *Developing Solutions on Oracle Blockchain Platform*, concludes the
    book with details on chaincode development, such as the programming languages
    required, development tools, and a development environment setup. This chapter
    teaches you about mapping asset models, operations, and developing chaincode functions
    and interfaces. It highlights the full life cycle of chaincode from development
    to updates; which includes installing, initiating, testing, and versioning. It
    demonstrates the full chaincode with a code base built on Go and Node.js. The
    chapter also illustrates endorsement policies, private data collections, and their
    functioning in concert with chaincode. It covers chaincode testing via shim and
    REST endpoints and integrating client apps with business networks using SDK, REST,
    and events. Finally, it concludes with insights into chaincode, transactions,
    and channels by experimenting with the monitoring of a business via chaincode
    logs and channel logs.
