    a computational algorithm and a data structure to solve the long-standing problem
    of several sectors. Blockchain technology is still emerging, and it is new to
    various organizations. However, the real problem is not just about knowing the
    technology; it is more about knowing if it is worth solving existing problems
    with blockchain technology.

    It also takes you to the go-to-market with blockchain. This is a simplified layout
    to demonstrate under what condition blockchain integration can be a good fit for
    your organization. IBM Hyperledger Fabric is built to provide private blockchain
    solutions for industries as shown in the following diagram:'

    blockchain flavor is best suited for your business needs. This was developed in
    May 2017 and was designed to structure methodology to determine solutions for
    business problems, such as the supply chain management, the inter-bank and international
    payment gateway, and decentralized autonomous organizations. See the following

    specifically to make a appropriate blockchain selection method. The context of
    the flow is more about identifying the need of integrity for parties. If integrity
    has to be maintained by a selected group, then a private blockchain is a better
    choice. However, if it is about incentives or rewards, then a public blockchain
    is a better choice. See the following diagram:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Conflict situations**: The blockchain network connects not only the trusted
    parties, but also the untrusted parties. As a result, it is critical to pay attention
    to conflicting situations and solve them seamlessly. Blockchain makes use of consensus
    algorithms to confirm transactions and prepare blocks. Different blockchains use
    different consensus models such as **Proof-of-****Work** (**PoW**), **Proof-of-Stake**
    (**PoS**), and many more, but the purpose remains the same, which is to avoid
    conflict and perform successful transactions.'

- en: '**Shared common database**: If the organization is sharing a common database
    across their employees (administrator or non-IT ), contractors, or third-parties,
    the **permissioned blockchain** can really fit into the requirement. When a centralized
    database is shared across the different parties, it increases the risk of access
    control exploitation that can be made with privilege escalation. When a permissioned
    blockchain is used, it ensures that only the committing peers get rights to make
    changes to the database, whereas transaction endorsement can be done by any of
    the preselected participants.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Need of business rules for transactions**: If the business model requires
    that you have a simple or complex logical policy to execute any transaction, blockchain
    can provide great assurance through its logical policies, such as the smart contract
    of Ethereum or the chaincode of Hyperledger. The business policy will always be
    defined in the node software that will force the node to work as per the defined
    rules.'

  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Need of system transparency**: If an organization''s business model requires
    that it must have transparency to their customers or suppliers throughout the
    supply chain, distributed-ledger technology can play a better role to provide
    end-to-end visibility of the supply chain operation and management system. In
    a permissionless blockchain network, each node is allowed access to read and write
    the blockchain ledger and hence becomes transparent as well. However, businesses
    are always more biased with permissioned environments where only preselected nodes
    are participating in the blockchain computation process and ledger management.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Need of data immutability**: If an organization is in need of developing
    a highly secured append-only database, both cryptography hashing and digital signatures
    help us build a highly secure ledger. As in the preparation of every block, it
    takes the hash of the previous block, and so it is impossible to modify or rearrange
    the database once it''s been created.'

    nature, the entire database is stored with each node across the blockchain network
    (in the case of the permissioned ledger, only the pre-selected participants can
    be allowed to read and store the data, as a result, time to replicate the database
    will take a long time and can lead to slowness). There are some solutions that
    are built to complete this purpose; let''s have a quick glance over each of them.'

    are set and initiated, it will not change the execution path. Organizations with
    frequently changing business processes and operations are not recommended for
    blockchain-based applications. Each subsystem and subprocess inside the blockchain
    network has to be deterministic.'

    smart contract is not built to fetch information from external sources. Even if
    it is configured to have communication between the blockchain and a trusted database,
    it will be operated as a regular database operation. Also, in this situation,
    the blockchain smart contract won''t be pulling entries from the external database;
    rather, the trusted database has to push the data onto the blockchain.'

    of finance executives said that their organizations have not developed the required
    blockchain skills. The lack of blockchain expertise in the global market leads
    to less attention regarding its potential business use cases and several implementation
    methods. Although blockchain is fundamentally a transformative technology, the
    way to turn up the blockchain backend system is still with the programming language,
    such as Node.js, JavaScript, and some newly developed languages, such as Go and
    Solidity. However, programmers alone cannot be enough to turn up the system. It
    is critical to have blockchain consultants who understand the business process
    and core elements to determine the blockchain application flow.'

    is effective from May 25, 2018, is changing the strategies for not only businesses
    running in Europe but also businesses around the globe (those with a customer
    base in a European region). GDPR has rolled out this concept, which is the exact
    opposite to the fundamentals of blockchain. Organizations under GDPR must have
    the **Create, Read, Update, Delete** (**CRUD**) operation on all their databases;
    however, blockchain databases can''t allow users or administrators to update or
    delete any entry from the database. Secondly, GDPR states that personal information
    should not leave the EU, whereas a major problem with the public blockchain was
    that a distributed model doesn''t allow you to restrict the storage of data to
    a specific node or group of nodes.'

    will be a barrier, again, that is, distributed networks. Its default nature to
    ensure the availability of the same database with all nodes can be an obstacle
    for heavy-sized data. There are several startups working on this problem to overcome

    great solution in the cyber security portfolio by enhancing data security when
    transactions of any kind of value are being processed in the distributed network.
    Blockchain is changing the cyber security solution in several ways. After cloud
    computing and several other digital evolutions, it is obvious that organizations
    should use hundreds of applications (internal and cloud-based) for several business
    needs. This also gives rise to the level of data breaches for end users and organizations.

    As it has been clearly demonstrated, blockchain is all about providing data security
    and privacy for confidential information, and blockchain is likely to be a great
    attraction for several business applications to provide better security and privacy.
