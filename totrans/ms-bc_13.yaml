    interest in it by academics and the commercial sector. As the technology is becoming
    mature, a few trends have started to emerge recently. For example, private blockchains
    have recently gained quite a lot of attention due to their specific use cases
    in finance. Also, enterprise blockchains are another new trend that is aiming
    to develop blockchain solutions that meets enterprise-level efficiency, security,
    and integration requirements. Some of the trends are listed below and discussed.

    on a specific industry, for example, everledger, which is a blockchain that has
    been developed to be used for providing an immutable tracing history and audit
    trail for diamonds and other high-value items. This approach thwarts any fraud
    attempts because everything related to ownership, authenticity, and value of the
    items is verified and recorded on the blockchain. This is very valuable for insurance
    and law enforcement agencies.

    due to privacy and scalability issues, a recent trend in developing enterprise-grade
    blockchains has emerged, whereby various companies have started to provide enterprise-grade
    blockchain solutions that are ready to be deployed and integrated at enterprise
    level. Requirements such as testing, documentation, integration, and security
    are all addressed already in this type of solution and can be implemented with
    minimal or no change at the enterprise level. This is in contrast to public blockchains,
    which are unregulated and do not meet specific enterprise-level security requirements.
    This also implies that enterprise-grade blockchains are usually supposed to be
    implemented in private configurations; however, public enterprise-grade blockchain
    implementation is also a possibility. 2016 has been a year when many technology
    start-ups have started to offer enterprise-grade blockchain solutions such as
    bloq, tylmez, chain, and many others. This trend continues to grow and 2017 will
    see more technology initiatives like this.

    private distributed ledgers that can be used within a group of trusted participants.
    As public blockchains, due to their open and comparatively less secure nature,
    are not suitable for industries such as finance, medicine, and law, private blockchains
    hold the promise to address this limitation and bring end users one step closer
    to reaping the benefits of blockchains while meeting all security and privacy
    requirements. Public blockchains are less secure because generally they do not
    provide privacy and confidentiality services. Private blockchains allow the participants
    or a subset of participants to be in full control of the system, thus making it
    desirable for use in finance and other industries where privacy and control are
    required.

    and the commercial sector. In recent years, the interest has greatly increased
    and now major institutions and researchers around the world are exploring this
    technology. This growth in interest is especially due to the fact that blockchain
    technology can help to make businesses efficient, reduce costs, and make things
    transparent. Academic interest is around addressing hard problems in cryptography,
    consensus mechanisms, performance, and addressing other limitations in blockchains.
    As blockchain technology comes under the wider umbrella of distributed systems,
    many researchers from distributed computing research have focused their research
    on blockchain technology. For example, UCL has a dedicated department, the *UCL
    Research Centre for Blockchain Technologies*, that focuses on blockchain technology
    research. Another example is the ETH Zurich distributed computing group that has
    published seminal research regarding blockchain technology. A recent journal called
    the Ledger Journal has recently published its first issue of research papers.
    It is available at [http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger](http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger).
    There are now teams and departments dedicated to blockchain research and development
    in various academic and commercial institutes. Although the above-mentioned initiatives
    are not an exhaustive list by any stretch of imagination, it is still a solid
    indication that this is a subject of extreme interest for researchers, and more
    research and development is expected to be seen in 2017 and beyond. Another organization
    called **The Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts **(**IC3**), is also
    conducting research in smart contract and blockchain technologies. IC3 aims to
    address performance, confidentiality, and safety issues in blockchains and smart
    contracts and runs multiple projects to address these issues. More information

    with existing systems. Even, as the current technology stands, two blockchain
    networks cannot easily talk to each other. Standardization will help to improve
    interoperability, adoptability, and integration aspects of blockchain technology.
    Some attempts have been made recently to address this and the most notable out
    of these attempts is the establishment of ISO/TC 307, which is a technical committee
    with the scope of standardizing blockchain and distributed ledger technology.
    The aim of the committee revolves around increasing interoperability and data
    interchange between users, applications, and systems. On the other hand, the recent
    creation of consortia and open source collaborative efforts such as R3 and Hyperledger
    has helped with standardization of this technology by sharing ideas, tools, and
    code with other participants. R3 works with a consortium of more than 80 banks
    that all have similar goals, which in a way results in standardization. Hyperledger,
    on the other hand, has a reference architecture that can be used to build blockchain
    systems and is supported by the Linux foundation and many other participants from
    the industry. Another example is the chain open standard, which is a protocol
    developed for financial networks. The chain OS1 standard is already available,
    which was built in collaboration with major financial institutions around the
    world. This standard allows faster settlement of transactions and immediate peer-to-peer
    transaction routing. It aims to address regulatory, security, and privacy requirements
    in blockchain technologies. OS1 also provides a framework for smart contract development
    and allows the participant to meet AML and KYC requirements easily.

    blockchain technology. There are certain limitations in blockchain technology,
    such as scalability, privacy, and interoperability, that are required to be addressed
    before it can become mainstream like any other technology. Recently, there have
    been tremendous efforts made toward addressing scalability issues in blockchain
    technology, which have been discussed in the previous chapter. Also blockchain-specific
    improvement proposals such as **BIPs** (**bitcoin improvement proposals**) and
    **EIPs** (**Ethereum improvement proposals**) are being made regularly by developers
    to address various concerns in these systems. Some recent and notable improvement
    proposals for both of these chains will be discussed later in the chapter. Moreover,
    recent advancements such as state channels are examples that blockchain technology

    bitcoins, miners started shifting toward optimizing mining hardware. These initial
    efforts included usage of **graphical processing units** (**GPUs**) and then **field-programmable
    gate arrays** (**FPGAs**) were used after GPUs reached their limit. Very quickly
    after that, **application-specific integrated circuits** (**ASICs**) emerged,
    which increased the mining power significantly. This trend is expected to grow
    further as now there is more research in further optimizing ASICs by parallelizing
    and decreasing the die size. Moreover, GPU programming initiatives are also expected
    to grow because new cryptocurrencies are emerging quite regularly now and many
    of them make use of Proof of Work algorithms that can benefit from GPU processing
    capabilities. For example, recently Zcash has spurred interest in GPU mining rigs
    and related programming using NVidia CUDA and OpenCL. The aim is to use multiple
    GPUs in parallel for optimizing mining operations. Also, some research has been

- en: As the blockchain technology advanced in recent years, researchers started to
    think about the possibility of creating platforms that can provide guarantees
    and services which a blockchain provides but without the need for a blockchain.
    This has resulted in development of R3's Corda, which in fact is not really a
    blockchain because it is not based on the concept of blocks containing transactions;
    instead, it is based on the concept of a state object that transverses throughout
    the Corda network according to the requirements and rules of the network participants
    representing the latest state of the network. Other examples include IOTA, which
    is an IoT blockchain which makes use of a **Directed Acyclic Graph** (**DAG**)
    as a distributed ledger named *Tangle,* instead of conventional blockchain with
    blocks. This ledger is claimed to have addressed scalability issues along with
    high-level security which even protects against quantum computing based attacks.
    It should be noted that bitcoin is also somewhat protected against quantum attacks
    because the quantum attack can only work on exposed public keys which are only
    revealed on the blockchain if both send and receive transactions are made. If
    the public key is not revealed, which is the case in unused addresses or the addresses
    that may have only used to receive bitcoins, then quantum safety can be guaranteed.
    In other words, using a different address for each transaction provides protection
    against quantum attacks. Also, in bitcoin, it is quite easy to change to another
    quantum signature protocol if required.

    integration with existing systems, and implementation costs.

- en: Regulation is considered one of the biggest challenges that need to be addressed.
    The core issue is that blockchains and especially cryptocurrencies are not recognized
    as a legal currency by any government. Even though, in some cases, it has been
    classified as money in the US and Germany, it is still far from being accepted
    as a normal currency. Moreover, blockchains in their current state are not recognized
    as a platform that can be used by financial institutions. No financial regulatory
    body has yet accepted it as a platform that can be authorized to be used. There
    are, however, various initiatives taken by regulatory authorities around the world
    to research and propose regulations. Bitcoin in its current state is fully unregulated,
    even though some attempts have been made by governments to tax the bitcoin. In
    the UK, under the EU VAT directive, bitcoin transactions are exempt from **Value
    Added Tax** (**VAT**) but this may change after Brexit. However, **Capital Gains
    Tax** (**CGT**) may still be applicable in some scenarios.

    production deployments. Even though the bitcoin blockchain has evolved into a
    solid blockchain platform and is used in production, it is not suitable for every
    scenario. This is especially true in the case of sensitive environments such as
    finance and health. However, it is likely to change very soon as ample efforts
    discussed previously in the chapter are being made to improve the technology and
    address any technical limitations such as scalability and privacy. Security is
    also another general concern which has been highlighted by many researchers and
    is especially applicable to the finance and health sectors. A recent report by
    the **European Union Agency for Network and Information Security** (**ENISA**)
    has highlighted distributed ledger specific concerns that should be addressed.
    Some concerns highlighted in the report include smart contract management, key
    management, anti-money-laundering, and anti-fraud tools. Also, the need for regulation,
    audit, control, and governance has been highlighted in the report.

- en: With the key attributes of censorship resistance and decentralization, blockchain
    technology can help to improve transparency and efficiency in many walks of life
    but this somewhat unregulated nature of this technology means that it can be used
    by criminals for illegal activities too. For example, compare a scenario where
    if some illegal content is published over the Internet it can be immediately shut
    down by approaching the concerned authorities and website service providers but
    this is not possible in blockchains. Once something is there on the blockchain,
    it is almost impossible to revert it back. This means that any inacceptable content,
    once published on the blockchain, cannot be removed. If the blockchain is used
    for distributing immoral content then there is no way for anyone to shut it down.
    This poses a serious challenge and it seems that some regulation and control is
    beneficial in this scenario, but how can a blockchain be regulated? That is another
    important question. It may not be prudent to create the regulatory laws first
    and then see if blockchain technology adapts to that because it might disrupt
    innovation and progress in this technology. It would be more sensible to let the
    blockchain technology grow first, just like the Internet and when it reaches a
    critical mass then governing bodies can call for applying some regulation around
    the implementation and usage of blockchain technology.

    to perform illegal activities. For example, *SilkRoad,* which was used to sell
    illegal drugs over the Internet, used bitcoin for payments and the Dark Web using
    onion URLs which are only visible with *Tor*. Although *SilkRoad* was shut down
    after months of effort by law enforcement agencies, new similar sites started
    to emerge. Now other alternatives are available that offer similar services; as
    such, generally, this type of problem still remains a big concern. Imagine that
    an illegal website is on IPFS and a blockchain; there is no easy way of shutting
    it down. It is clear that absence of control and regulation can encourage criminal
    activity and similar issue like *SilkRoad* will keep arising. Further development
    in totally anonymous transaction capabilities such as Zcash could provide another
    layer of protection for criminals but at the same time may be quite useful in
    various legitimate scenarios. It really depends that who is using the technology;
    anonymity can be good in many scenarios, for example in the health industry where
    patient records should be kept private and anonymous, but may not be appropriate
    if it can also be used by criminals to hide their activities.

- en: One solution might be to introduce intelligent bots or AAs or even contracts
    that are programmed with regulatory logic embedded within them. They are most
    likely to be programmed by regulators and law enforcement agencies and *live* on
    the blockchain as a means to provide governance and control. For example, a blockchain
    could be designed in such a way that every smart contract has to go through a
    *controller contract* that scrutinizes the code logic and provides a regulatory
    mechanism to control the behavior of the smart contract. It may also be possible
    to get each smart contract's code to be inspected by regulatory authorities and
    once a smart contract code has a certain level of authenticity attached to it
    in the form of certificates issued by a regulator, it can be deployed on the blockchain
    network. This concept of binary signing is akin to the concept of already established
    concept of code signing where by executables are digitally signed as a means to
    confirm that the code is bona fide and is not malicious. This idea is more applicable
    in the context of semi-private or regulated blockchains, where a certain degree
    of control is required by a regulatory authority, for example, in finance. It
    means that there is some degree of trust required to be placed in a trusted third
    party (regulator) which may not be desirable due to deviation from the concept
    of full decentralization. However, to address this, the blockchain itself can
    be used to provide a decentralized, transparent, and secure certificate issuance
    and digital signing mechanism.

    (**DAG**) which is used to store transactions as compared to traditional blockchain
    solutions where a block is used to store transactions. This makes it inherently

    that can make rational decisions based on the scenarios and environment that they
    observe around them. Machine learning plays a vital role in AI by making use of
    raw data as a learning resource. A key requirement in AI-based systems is the
    availability of authentic data that can be used for machine learning and model
    building. The explosion of data coming out IoT devices, smartphone's, and other
    data acquisition means that AI and machine learning is becoming more and more
    powerful. There is, however, a requirement of authenticity of data. Once consumers,
    producers, and other entities are on a blockchain, the data that is generated
    as a result of interaction between these entities can be readily used as an input
    to machine learning engines with a guarantee of authenticity. This is where AI
    converges with blockchains. It could be argued that if an IoT device is hacked,
    it can send malformed data to the blockchain. This issue is mitigated because
    an IoT device is part of the blockchain (as a node) and has all security properties
    applied to it as a normal node in the blockchain network. These properties include
    incentivization of good behavior, rejection of malformed transactions, and strict
    verification of transactions and various other checks that are part of blockchain
    protocol. Therefore, even if an IoT device is somehow hacked, it would be treated
    as a Byzantine node by the blockchain network and would not cause any adverse
    impact on the network.

    of research currently and more interest and development is expected in these areas
    in the near future.

- en: Blockchains are going to change the world. The revolution has already started
    and it is only expected to grow at an exponential scale. This chapter has explored
    various projects and the current state of blockchain technology. First, a few
    trends were discussed that are expected to continue as the technology progresses
    further. There is deep research interest in blockchain technology by many researchers
    and organizations around the world and some research topics have also been introduced
    in this chapter. Furthermore, convergence with other fields such as the IoT and
    AI has also been discussed. Finally, some predictions regarding the growth of
    blockchain technology have been made. Most of these predictions are likely to
    come true within the next decade or so, while some may take a longer time. Blockchain
    technology has the potential to change the world and a few positive signs have
    already been seen in the form of successful Proof of concept implementations and
    a growing number of enthusiasts and developers taking interest in this technology.
    Very soon, blockchains will be intertwined with our lives just as the Internet
    is now. This chapter is just a modest overview of the vast and tremendous potential
    of blockchains, and in the near future, exponential growth in this technology
    is expected.
