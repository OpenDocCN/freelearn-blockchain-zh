    ledger is specifically developed for only one application in mind and is focused
    on a specific industry, for example, everledger, which is a blockchain that has
    been developed to be used for providing an immutable tracing history and audit
    trail for diamonds and other high-value items. This approach thwarts any fraud
    attempts because everything related to ownership, authenticity, and value of the
    items is verified and recorded on the blockchain. This is very valuable for insurance

    due to privacy and scalability issues, a recent trend in developing enterprise-grade
    blockchains has emerged, whereby various companies have started to provide enterprise-grade
    blockchain solutions that are ready to be deployed and integrated at enterprise
    level. Requirements such as testing, documentation, integration, and security
    are all addressed already in this type of solution and can be implemented with
    minimal or no change at the enterprise level. This is in contrast to public blockchains,
    which are unregulated and do not meet specific enterprise-level security requirements.
    This also implies that enterprise-grade blockchains are usually supposed to be
    implemented in private configurations; however, public enterprise-grade blockchain
    implementation is also a possibility. 2016 has been a year when many technology
    start-ups have started to offer enterprise-grade blockchain solutions such as
    bloq, tylmez, chain, and many others. This trend continues to grow and 2017 will
    see more technology initiatives like this.

    private distributed ledgers that can be used within a group of trusted participants.
    As public blockchains, due to their open and comparatively less secure nature,
    are not suitable for industries such as finance, medicine, and law, private blockchains
    hold the promise to address this limitation and bring end users one step closer
    to reaping the benefits of blockchains while meeting all security and privacy
    requirements. Public blockchains are less secure because generally they do not
    provide privacy and confidentiality services. Private blockchains allow the participants
    or a subset of participants to be in full control of the system, thus making it
    desirable for use in finance and other industries where privacy and control are
    required.

- en: Blockchain technology has stimulated intense research interest both in academia
    and the commercial sector. In recent years, the interest has greatly increased
    and now major institutions and researchers around the world are exploring this
    technology. This growth in interest is especially due to the fact that blockchain
    technology can help to make businesses efficient, reduce costs, and make things
    transparent. Academic interest is around addressing hard problems in cryptography,
    consensus mechanisms, performance, and addressing other limitations in blockchains.
    As blockchain technology comes under the wider umbrella of distributed systems,
    many researchers from distributed computing research have focused their research
    on blockchain technology. For example, UCL has a dedicated department, the *UCL
    Research Centre for Blockchain Technologies*, that focuses on blockchain technology
    research. Another example is the ETH Zurich distributed computing group that has
    published seminal research regarding blockchain technology. A recent journal called
    the Ledger Journal has recently published its first issue of research papers.
    It is available at [http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger](http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger).
    There are now teams and departments dedicated to blockchain research and development
    in various academic and commercial institutes. Although the above-mentioned initiatives
    are not an exhaustive list by any stretch of imagination, it is still a solid
    indication that this is a subject of extreme interest for researchers, and more
    research and development is expected to be seen in 2017 and beyond. Another organization
    called **The Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts **(**IC3**), is also
    conducting research in smart contract and blockchain technologies. IC3 aims to
    address performance, confidentiality, and safety issues in blockchains and smart
    contracts and runs multiple projects to address these issues. More information

    with existing systems. Even, as the current technology stands, two blockchain
    networks cannot easily talk to each other. Standardization will help to improve
    interoperability, adoptability, and integration aspects of blockchain technology.
    Some attempts have been made recently to address this and the most notable out
    of these attempts is the establishment of ISO/TC 307, which is a technical committee
    with the scope of standardizing blockchain and distributed ledger technology.
    The aim of the committee revolves around increasing interoperability and data
    interchange between users, applications, and systems. On the other hand, the recent
    creation of consortia and open source collaborative efforts such as R3 and Hyperledger
    has helped with standardization of this technology by sharing ideas, tools, and
    code with other participants. R3 works with a consortium of more than 80 banks
    that all have similar goals, which in a way results in standardization. Hyperledger,
    on the other hand, has a reference architecture that can be used to build blockchain
    systems and is supported by the Linux foundation and many other participants from
    the industry. Another example is the chain open standard, which is a protocol
    developed for financial networks. The chain OS1 standard is already available,
    which was built in collaboration with major financial institutions around the
    world. This standard allows faster settlement of transactions and immediate peer-to-peer
    transaction routing. It aims to address regulatory, security, and privacy requirements
    in blockchain technologies. OS1 also provides a framework for smart contract development
    and allows the participant to meet AML and KYC requirements easily.

    which increased the mining power significantly. This trend is expected to grow
    further as now there is more research in further optimizing ASICs by parallelizing
    and decreasing the die size. Moreover, GPU programming initiatives are also expected
    to grow because new cryptocurrencies are emerging quite regularly now and many
    of them make use of Proof of Work algorithms that can benefit from GPU processing
    capabilities. For example, recently Zcash has spurred interest in GPU mining rigs
    and related programming using NVidia CUDA and OpenCL. The aim is to use multiple
    GPUs in parallel for optimizing mining operations. Also, some research has been
    in the field of using trusted computing hardware such as Intel's **Software Guard
    extensions** (**SGX**) to address security issues on blockchains. Also Intel's
    SGX has been used in a novel consensus algorithm called **Proof of Elapsed Time**
    (**PoET**) which has been discussed in previous chapters. Another project, *the
    21 bitcoin computer*, has also been developed, which serves as a platform for
    developers to learn bitcoin technology and easily develop applications for the
    bitcoin platform.

  zh: 区块链的替代方案
- en: As the blockchain technology advanced in recent years, researchers started to
    think about the possibility of creating platforms that can provide guarantees
    and services which a blockchain provides but without the need for a blockchain.
    This has resulted in development of R3's Corda, which in fact is not really a
    blockchain because it is not based on the concept of blocks containing transactions;
    instead, it is based on the concept of a state object that transverses throughout
    the Corda network according to the requirements and rules of the network participants
    representing the latest state of the network. Other examples include IOTA, which
    is an IoT blockchain which makes use of a **Directed Acyclic Graph** (**DAG**)
    as a distributed ledger named *Tangle,* instead of conventional blockchain with
    blocks. This ledger is claimed to have addressed scalability issues along with
    high-level security which even protects against quantum computing based attacks.
    It should be noted that bitcoin is also somewhat protected against quantum attacks
    because the quantum attack can only work on exposed public keys which are only
    revealed on the blockchain if both send and receive transactions are made. If
    the public key is not revealed, which is the case in unused addresses or the addresses
    that may have only used to receive bitcoins, then quantum safety can be guaranteed.
    In other words, using a different address for each transaction provides protection
    against quantum attacks. Also, in bitcoin, it is quite easy to change to another
    quantum signature protocol if required.

    body has yet accepted it as a platform that can be authorized to be used. There
    are, however, various initiatives taken by regulatory authorities around the world

    even though some attempts have been made by governments to tax the bitcoin. In

- en: With the key attributes of censorship resistance and decentralization, blockchain
    technology can help to improve transparency and efficiency in many walks of life
    but this somewhat unregulated nature of this technology means that it can be used
    by criminals for illegal activities too. For example, compare a scenario where
    if some illegal content is published over the Internet it can be immediately shut
    down by approaching the concerned authorities and website service providers but
    this is not possible in blockchains. Once something is there on the blockchain,
    it is almost impossible to revert it back. This means that any inacceptable content,
    once published on the blockchain, cannot be removed. If the blockchain is used
    for distributing immoral content then there is no way for anyone to shut it down.
    This poses a serious challenge and it seems that some regulation and control is
    beneficial in this scenario, but how can a blockchain be regulated? That is another
    important question. It may not be prudent to create the regulatory laws first
    and then see if blockchain technology adapts to that because it might disrupt
    innovation and progress in this technology. It would be more sensible to let the
    blockchain technology grow first, just like the Internet and when it reaches a
    critical mass then governing bodies can call for applying some regulation around
    the implementation and usage of blockchain technology.

  zh: 具有审查抵抗和去中心化的关键属性，区块链技术可以帮助提高许多领域的透明度和效率，但这种技术的相对无监管性意味着它也可以被犯罪分子用于非法活动。例如，比较一种情景，如果一些非法内容在互联网上发布，可以立即通过联系有关当局和网站服务提供商来关闭，但这在区块链上是不可能的。一旦某事出现在区块链上，几乎不可能将其恢复。这意味着一旦在区块链上发布了任何不可接受的内容，就无法删除。如果区块链用于分发不道德的内容，那么任何人都无法关闭它。这带来了严重的挑战，看起来在这种情况下一些监管和控制是有益的，但如何监管区块链呢？这是另一个重要的问题。首先制定监管法律，然后看区块链技术是否适应这些法律可能不明智，因为这可能会扰乱该技术的创新和进步。更明智的做法是先让区块链技术发展起来，就像互联网一样，当它达到临界质量时，监管机构可以呼吁对区块链技术的实施和使用施加一些监管。
- en: There are various examples where the Dark Web is used in conjunction with bitcoin
    to perform illegal activities. For example, *SilkRoad,* which was used to sell
    illegal drugs over the Internet, used bitcoin for payments and the Dark Web using
    onion URLs which are only visible with *Tor*. Although *SilkRoad* was shut down
    after months of effort by law enforcement agencies, new similar sites started
    to emerge. Now other alternatives are available that offer similar services; as
    such, generally, this type of problem still remains a big concern. Imagine that
    an illegal website is on IPFS and a blockchain; there is no easy way of shutting
    it down. It is clear that absence of control and regulation can encourage criminal
    activity and similar issue like *SilkRoad* will keep arising. Further development
    in totally anonymous transaction capabilities such as Zcash could provide another
    layer of protection for criminals but at the same time may be quite useful in
    various legitimate scenarios. It really depends that who is using the technology;
    anonymity can be good in many scenarios, for example in the health industry where
    patient records should be kept private and anonymous, but may not be appropriate
    if it can also be used by criminals to hide their activities.

- en: One solution might be to introduce intelligent bots or AAs or even contracts
    that are programmed with regulatory logic embedded within them. They are most
    likely to be programmed by regulators and law enforcement agencies and *live* on
    the blockchain as a means to provide governance and control. For example, a blockchain
    could be designed in such a way that every smart contract has to go through a
    *controller contract* that scrutinizes the code logic and provides a regulatory
    mechanism to control the behavior of the smart contract. It may also be possible
    to get each smart contract's code to be inspected by regulatory authorities and
    once a smart contract code has a certain level of authenticity attached to it
    in the form of certificates issued by a regulator, it can be deployed on the blockchain
    network. This concept of binary signing is akin to the concept of already established
    concept of code signing where by executables are digitally signed as a means to
    confirm that the code is bona fide and is not malicious. This idea is more applicable
    in the context of semi-private or regulated blockchains, where a certain degree
    of control is required by a regulatory authority, for example, in finance. It
    means that there is some degree of trust required to be placed in a trusted third
    party (regulator) which may not be desirable due to deviation from the concept
    of full decentralization. However, to address this, the blockchain itself can
    be used to provide a decentralized, transparent, and secure certificate issuance
    and digital signing mechanism.

  zh: 一种解决方案可能是引入内嵌有监管逻辑的智能机器人或AAs甚至合同。它们很可能由监管机构和执法机构编程，并且*生存在*区块链上，作为提供治理和控制的手段。例如，可以设计一种区块链，使每个智能合约都必须经过一个*控制器合约*进行审查代码逻辑，并提供监管机制以控制智能合约的行为。监管机构还可以检查每个智能合约的代码，一旦智能合约代码具有监管机构颁发的证书所附的一定水平的真实性，就可以部署在区块链网络上。这种二进制签名的概念类似于已经建立的代码签名概念，其中可执行文件是数字签名的，以确认代码是真实的且不是恶意的。这个想法在半私有或受监管的区块链的背景下更为适用，其中监管机构需要一定程度的控制，例如在金融领域。这意味着需要对可信第三方（监管机构）放置一定程度的信任，这可能不太理想，因为它偏离了完全去中心化的概念。然而，为了解决这个问题，可以使用区块链本身提供的去中心化、透明和安全的证书发行和数字签名机制。

- en: Convergence of blockchain with IoT has been discussed at length in the last
    chapter. Briefly, it can be said that due to the authenticity, integrity, privacy,
    and shared nature of blockchains, IoT networks will benefit greatly from blockchain
    technology. This can be realized in the form of an IoT network that runs on a
    blockchain and makes use of a decentralized mesh network for communication in
    order to facilitate **machine-to-machine** (**M2M**) communication in real time.
    All this data which is generated as a result of M2M communication can be used
    in the machine learning process to augment the functionality of Artificially Intelligent
    DAOs or simple AAs. AAs can act as *agents* in a **Distributed Artificial Intelligence**
    (**DAI**) environment provided by a blockchain and can learn over time using machine
    learning processes.

- en: AI is a field of computer science that endeavors to build intelligent agents
    that can make rational decisions based on the scenarios and environment that they
    observe around them. Machine learning plays a vital role in AI by making use of
    raw data as a learning resource. A key requirement in AI-based systems is the
    availability of authentic data that can be used for machine learning and model
    building. The explosion of data coming out IoT devices, smartphone's, and other
    data acquisition means that AI and machine learning is becoming more and more
    powerful. There is, however, a requirement of authenticity of data. Once consumers,
    producers, and other entities are on a blockchain, the data that is generated
    as a result of interaction between these entities can be readily used as an input
    to machine learning engines with a guarantee of authenticity. This is where AI
    converges with blockchains. It could be argued that if an IoT device is hacked,
    it can send malformed data to the blockchain. This issue is mitigated because
    an IoT device is part of the blockchain (as a node) and has all security properties
    applied to it as a normal node in the blockchain network. These properties include
    incentivization of good behavior, rejection of malformed transactions, and strict
    verification of transactions and various other checks that are part of blockchain
    protocol. Therefore, even if an IoT device is somehow hacked, it would be treated
    as a Byzantine node by the blockchain network and would not cause any adverse
    impact on the network.

    contracts, and AAs will give rise to **Artificially Intelligent Decentralized
    Autonomous Organizations** (**AIDAOs**) that can act on behalf of humans to run
    entire organizations on their own. This is another side of AI that can become
    norm in the future. However, more research is required in order to realize this
    vision.

    allows for more transparency and can ensure that no central authority is gaining
    unfair advantage by manipulating the game rules. All these topics are active areas
    of research currently and more interest and development is expected in these areas
    in the near future.

    and it is only expected to grow at an exponential scale. This chapter has explored
    various projects and the current state of blockchain technology. First, a few
    trends were discussed that are expected to continue as the technology progresses
    further. There is deep research interest in blockchain technology by many researchers
    and organizations around the world and some research topics have also been introduced
    in this chapter. Furthermore, convergence with other fields such as the IoT and
    AI has also been discussed. Finally, some predictions regarding the growth of
    blockchain technology have been made. Most of these predictions are likely to
    come true within the next decade or so, while some may take a longer time. Blockchain
    technology has the potential to change the world and a few positive signs have
    already been seen in the form of successful Proof of concept implementations and
    a growing number of enthusiasts and developers taking interest in this technology.
    Very soon, blockchains will be intertwined with our lives just as the Internet
    is now. This chapter is just a modest overview of the vast and tremendous potential
    of blockchains, and in the near future, exponential growth in this technology
    is expected.
