    Coins can be sent or received using wallets. Wallets can store data either in
    databases or in structured files. For example, the Bitcoin core client wallets
    use the Berkeley DB file.

- en: A wallet of any cryptocurrency can store multiple public and private keys. The
    cryptocurrency is itself not contained in the wallet; instead, the cryptocurrency
    is de-centrally stored and maintained in the public ledger. Every cryptocurrency
    has a private key with which it is possible to write in the public ledger, which
    makes spending in the cryptocurrency possible.

    is crucial in order to keep the currency safe. Wallet is a collection of public
    and private keys, and each of them is important for the security and anonymity
    of the currency holder.

    store the private key in them, which is used to sign a transaction. The signature
    of a transaction is generated from the combination of private and public keys.
    It is important to store the private key securely.

    if the private key is lost the coins associated with that private key are lost

    currencies the wallets support; for example, there can be wallets with single
    currency support or multiple currency support. Each of the coins has a core client

    wallets store the private key in a custom hardware designed to store private keys.
    It is not possible to export the private key in plain text, which gives it another
    layer of security. Hardware is connected to a computer only when required, and
    at all other times the private key is kept secure. Hardware wallets were first
    introduced in 2012 by Trezor.

    generated private keys. This type of wallet is being discontinued due to a major
    disadvantage, that the random keys are inaccessible if the wallet is lost. Since
    it is advisable to use a different address for every transaction in order to maintain
    anonymity on the network, with so many random keys, it becomes difficult to maintain
    and, hence, addresses became prone to re-use. Even though in the Bitcoin core-client,
    there is a wallet that is implemented as a type-0 wallet, its use is widely discouraged.
