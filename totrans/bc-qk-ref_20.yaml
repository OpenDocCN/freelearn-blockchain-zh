    We have discussed various intricacies involved in Bitcoin's, its blockchain, and
    other elements that form the blockchain. Ethereum has been a good topic of interest
    for most parts of the book so far. We have also read about other blockchain-based
    projects that comprise currency-based projects.

    has its own benefits over the other. Prior to creating a currency, it is important
    to know all the intricacies involved, and what your coin offers compared to other
    existing coins currently available at exchanges. A list of popular coins can be

    in the previous [Chapter 15](588b84f6-baef-4ea3-895e-bd66f523452b.xhtml), *Ethereum
    Development*. A token helps in creating a coin faster, and supports a quick go-to
    market strategy so that most of the time can be invested in further development
    of a self-hosted blockchain.

    post a successful ICO once they start their own fully supported blockchain complete
    with a coin. Since it is faster and easier to develop a token as compared to a
    coin, it becomes easy for such projects to gain traction and also get launched
    in no time, and most of the time can be invested in other important tasks such
    as whitepaper creation, ICO, and so on.

    source was forked from Bitcoin's core code, including the wallet and other sources
    of Bitcoin. The major change that Litecoin has over Bitcoin is that the PoW algorithm
    is script instead of Bitcoin's SHA-256\. Apart from this, Litecoin has a coin
    supply limit of 84,000,000 LTC, and the block time is 2.5 minutes.
