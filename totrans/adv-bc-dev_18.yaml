    deep interest in it by academics and the commercial sector. As the technology
    is becoming mature, a few trends have started to emerge recently. For example,
    private blockchains have recently gained quite a lot of attention due to their
    specific use cases in finance. Also, enterprise blockchains are another new trend
    that is aiming to develop blockchain solutions that meet enterprise-level efficiency,
    security, and integration requirements. Some of the trends are listed here and

    on a specific industry, for example, Everledger, ([https://www.everledger.io](https://www.everledger.io))
    which is a blockchain that has been developed to be used for providing an immutable
    tracing history and audit trail for diamonds and other high-value items. This
    approach thwarts any fraud attempts because everything related to ownership, authenticity,
    and value of the items is verified and recorded on the blockchain. This result
    is precious for insurance and law enforcement agencies.

    due to privacy and scalability issues, a recent trend in developing enterprise-grade
    blockchains has emerged, whereby various companies have started to provide enterprise-grade
    blockchain solutions that are ready to be deployed and integrated at an enterprise
    level. Requirements such as testing, documentation, integration, and security

    do not meet specific enterprise-level security requirements. This also implies
    that enterprise-grade blockchains are usually supposed to be implemented in private
    configurations; however, public enterprise-grade blockchain implementation is
    also a possibility. In recent years, many technology start-ups have started to
    offer enterprise-grade blockchain solutions such as Bloq, Tymlez, Chain, Colu,
    ChainThat, ChromaWay and many others. This trend continues to grow, and years

    private distributed ledgers that can be used within a group of trusted participants.
    As public blockchains, due to their open and comparatively less secure nature,
    are not suitable for industries such as finance, medicine, and law, private blockchains
    hold the promise to address this limitation and bring end users one step closer
    to reaping the benefits of blockchains while meeting all security and privacy
    requirements.

    think about the possibility of creating platforms that can provide guarantees
    and services which a blockchain provides but without the need for a blockchain.
    This has resulted in development of R3's Corda, which in fact is not really a
    blockchain because it is not based on the concept of blocks containing transactions;
    instead, it is based on the concept of a state object that transverses throughout
    the Corda network according to the requirements and rules of the network participants
    representing the latest state of the network. Other examples include IOTA, which
    is an IoT blockchain which makes use of a **Directed Acyclic Graph** (**DAG**)
    as a distributed ledger named Tangle, instead of conventional blockchain with
    blocks. This ledger is claimed to have addressed scalability issues along with
    high-level security which even protects against quantum computing based attacks.
    It should be noted that Bitcoin is also somewhat protected against quantum attacks
    because the quantum attacks can only work on exposed public keys which are only
    revealed on the blockchain if both send and receive transactions are made. If
    the public key is not revealed, which is the case in unused addresses or the addresses
    that may have only used to receive bitcoins, then quantum safety can be guaranteed.
    In other words, using a different address for each transaction protects against
    quantum attacks. Also, in Bitcoin, it is quite easy to change to another quantum
    signature protocol if required.

    technology can help to improve transparency and efficiency in many walks of life,
    but this somewhat unregulated nature of this technology means that it can be used
    by criminals for illegal activities too. For example, compare a scenario where
    if some illegal content is published over the internet it can be immediately shut
    down by approaching the concerned authorities and website service providers, but
    this is not possible in blockchains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once something is there on the blockchain, it is almost impossible to revert
    it. This means that any unacceptable content, once published on the blockchain,
    cannot be removed. If the blockchain is used for distributing immoral content,
    then there is no way for anyone to shut it down. This poses a serious challenge
    and it seems that some regulation and control is beneficial in this scenario,
    but how can a blockchain be regulated? That is another critical question. It may
    not be prudent to create the regulatory laws first and then see if blockchain
    technology adapts to that because it might disrupt innovation and progress in
    this technology. It would be more sensible to let the blockchain technology grow
    first, just like the internet and when it reaches a critical mass then governing
    bodies can call for applying some regulation around the implementation and usage
    of blockchain technology.

    to perform illegal activities. For example, Silk Road, which was used to sell
    illegal drugs over the internet, used bitcoins for payments and the Dark Web using
    onion URLs which are only visible with Tor. Although Silk Road was shut down after
    months of effort by law enforcement agencies, new similar sites started to emerge.
    Now, other alternatives are available that similar offer services; as such, generally,
    this type of problem remains a big concern.

    way of shutting it down. It is clear that absence of control and regulation can
    encourage criminal activity and similar issue like Silk Road will keep arising.
    Further development of totally anonymous transaction capabilities such as Zcash
    could provide another layer of protection for criminals but at the same time may
    be quite useful in various legitimate scenarios. It depends on that who is using
    the technology; anonymity can be good in many scenarios, for example in the health
    industry where patient records should be kept private and anonymous but may not
    be appropriate if it can also be used by criminals to hide their activities.

    that are programmed with regulatory logic embedded within them. They are most
    likely to be programmed by regulators and law enforcement agencies and live on
    the blockchain as a means to provide governance and control. For example, a blockchain
    could be designed in such a way that every smart contract has to go through a
    controller contract that scrutinizes the code logic and provides a regulatory
    mechanism to control the behavior of the smart contract.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may also be possible to get each smart contract's code to be inspected by
    regulatory authorities, and once a smart contract code has a certain level of
    authenticity attached to it in the form of certificates issued by a regulator,
    it can be deployed on the blockchain network. This concept of binary signing is
    akin to the concept of the already established concept of code signing whereby
    executables are digitally signed as a means to confirm that the code is bona fide
    and is not malicious. This idea is more applicable in the context of semiprivate
    or regulated blockchains, where a certain degree of control is required by a regulatory
    authority, for example, in finance. It means that there is some degree of trust
    required to be placed in a trusted third party (regulator) which may not be desirable
    due to deviation from the concept of full decentralization. However, to address
    this, the blockchain itself can be used to provide a decentralized, transparent,
    and secure certificate issuance and digital signing mechanism.

    to solve some mathematical or scientific problems. Also, alternatives such as
    PoS algorithms have already gained much traction and are due to be implemented

    scalability and further improve off-chain solutions such as state channels. Some
    initiatives like block size increase and transaction-only blockchains (without
    blocks) have been proposed to address scalability issues that increase the capacity
    of the blockchain itself instead of using side channels. Examples of without blocks
    implementation include IOTA (Tangle). It is a DAG which is used to store transactions
    as compared to traditional blockchain solutions where a block is used to store
    transactions. This makes it inherently faster as compared to block-based blockchains
    such as Bitcoin where waiting time between block generations is at least approximately
    10 minutes.

    Briefly, it can be said that due to the authenticity, integrity, privacy, and
    shared nature of blockchains, IoT networks will benefit greatly from blockchain
    technology. This can be realized in the form of an IoT network that runs on a
    blockchain and makes use of a decentralized mesh network for communication to
    facilitate **Machine-to-Machine** (**M2M**) communication in real time. All this
    data which is generated as a result of M2M communication can be used in the machine
    learning process to augment the functionality of Artificially Intelligent DAOs
    or simple AAs. AAs can act as agents in a **Distributed Artificial Intelligence**

    that can make rational decisions based on the scenarios and environment that they
    observe around them. Machine learning plays a vital role in AI by making use of
    raw data as a learning resource. A key requirement in AI-based systems is the
    availability of authentic data that can be used for machine learning and model
    building. The explosion of data coming out IoT devices, smartphone's, and other
    data acquisition means that AI and machine learning is becoming more and more
    powerful.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is, however, a requirement of authenticity of data. Once consumers, producers,
    and other entities are on a blockchain, the data that is generated as a result
    of interaction between these entities can be readily used as an input to machine
    learning engines with a guarantee of authenticity. This is where AI converges
    with blockchains. It could be argued that if an IoT device is hacked, it can send
    malformed data to the blockchain. This issue is mitigated because an IoT device
    is part of the blockchain (as a node) and has all security properties applied
    to it as a standard node in the blockchain network. These properties include incentivization
    of good behavior, rejection of malformed transactions, and strict verification
    of transactions and various other checks that are part of blockchain protocol.
    Therefore, even if an IoT device is somehow hacked, it would be treated as a Byzantine
    node by the blockchain network and would not cause any adverse impact on the network.
