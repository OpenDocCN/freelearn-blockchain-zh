    deep interest in it by academics and the commercial sector. As the technology
    is becoming mature, a few trends have started to emerge recently. For example,
    private blockchains have recently gained quite a lot of attention due to their
    specific use cases in finance. Also, enterprise blockchains are another new trend
    that is aiming to develop blockchain solutions that meet enterprise-level efficiency,
    security, and integration requirements. Some of the trends are listed here and
    discussed.

    ledger is specially developed for only one application in mind and is focused
    on a specific industry, for example, Everledger, ([https://www.everledger.io](https://www.everledger.io))
    which is a blockchain that has been developed to be used for providing an immutable
    tracing history and audit trail for diamonds and other high-value items. This
    approach thwarts any fraud attempts because everything related to ownership, authenticity,
    and value of the items is verified and recorded on the blockchain. This result
    is precious for insurance and law enforcement agencies.

    due to privacy and scalability issues, a recent trend in developing enterprise-grade
    blockchains has emerged, whereby various companies have started to provide enterprise-grade
    blockchain solutions that are ready to be deployed and integrated at an enterprise
    level. Requirements such as testing, documentation, integration, and security
    are all addressed already in this type of solution and can be implemented with
    minimal or no change at the enterprise level.

    do not meet specific enterprise-level security requirements. This also implies
    that enterprise-grade blockchains are usually supposed to be implemented in private
    configurations; however, public enterprise-grade blockchain implementation is
    also a possibility. In recent years, many technology start-ups have started to
    offer enterprise-grade blockchain solutions such as Bloq, Tymlez, Chain, Colu,
    ChainThat, ChromaWay and many others. This trend continues to grow, and years

    private distributed ledgers that can be used within a group of trusted participants.
    As public blockchains, due to their open and comparatively less secure nature,
    are not suitable for industries such as finance, medicine, and law, private blockchains
    hold the promise to address this limitation and bring end users one step closer
    to reaping the benefits of blockchains while meeting all security and privacy
    requirements.

    think about the possibility of creating platforms that can provide guarantees
    and services which a blockchain provides but without the need for a blockchain.
    This has resulted in development of R3's Corda, which in fact is not really a
    blockchain because it is not based on the concept of blocks containing transactions;
    instead, it is based on the concept of a state object that transverses throughout
    the Corda network according to the requirements and rules of the network participants
    representing the latest state of the network. Other examples include IOTA, which
    is an IoT blockchain which makes use of a **Directed Acyclic Graph** (**DAG**)
    as a distributed ledger named Tangle, instead of conventional blockchain with
    blocks. This ledger is claimed to have addressed scalability issues along with
    high-level security which even protects against quantum computing based attacks.
    It should be noted that Bitcoin is also somewhat protected against quantum attacks
    because the quantum attacks can only work on exposed public keys which are only
    revealed on the blockchain if both send and receive transactions are made. If
    the public key is not revealed, which is the case in unused addresses or the addresses
    that may have only used to receive bitcoins, then quantum safety can be guaranteed.
    In other words, using a different address for each transaction protects against
    quantum attacks. Also, in Bitcoin, it is quite easy to change to another quantum
    signature protocol if required.

    Of course, this computation secures the Bitcoin network but there is no other
    benefit of this computation, and it wastes much electrical energy. To reduce this
    waste, now there is more focus on greener options such as PoS algorithms which
    do not need enormous resources like Bitcoin's PoW algorithm. This trend is expected

    authority, for example, in finance. It means that there is some degree of trust

    The first type is used to provide basic services such as encryption and basic
    data fetching from external sources, whereas the latter is a more intelligent
    version that is created automatically when a smart contract is created on the
    chain and resides off the chain but still linked to the on-chain contract. Due
    to this off-chain existence, there is no need to execute the contract cryptlets
    on all nodes of the blockchain network. Therefore, this approach results in increased
    performance of the blockchain.'

    16](d0ef443d-d4b0-4afb-91f4-c5863ea1cf43.xhtml), *Scalability and Other Challenges*.
    Briefly, it can be said that due to the authenticity, integrity, privacy, and
    shared nature of blockchains, IoT networks will benefit greatly from blockchain
    technology. This can be realized in the form of an IoT network that runs on a
    blockchain and makes use of a decentralized mesh network for communication to
    facilitate **Machine-to-Machine** (**M2M**) communication in real time. All this
    data which is generated as a result of M2M communication can be used in the machine
    learning process to augment the functionality of Artificially Intelligent DAOs
    or simple AAs. AAs can act as agents in a **Distributed Artificial Intelligence**
    (**DAI**) environment provided by a blockchain and can learn over time using machine
    learning processes.
  id: totrans-172

- en: AI is a field of computer science that endeavors to build intelligent agents
    that can make rational decisions based on the scenarios and environment that they
    observe around them. Machine learning plays a vital role in AI by making use of
    raw data as a learning resource. A key requirement in AI-based systems is the
    availability of authentic data that can be used for machine learning and model
    building. The explosion of data coming out IoT devices, smartphone's, and other
    data acquisition means that AI and machine learning is becoming more and more
    powerful.
  id: totrans-173
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is, however, a requirement of authenticity of data. Once consumers, producers,
    and other entities are on a blockchain, the data that is generated as a result
    of interaction between these entities can be readily used as an input to machine
    learning engines with a guarantee of authenticity. This is where AI converges
    with blockchains. It could be argued that if an IoT device is hacked, it can send
    malformed data to the blockchain. This issue is mitigated because an IoT device
    is part of the blockchain (as a node) and has all security properties applied
    to it as a standard node in the blockchain network. These properties include incentivization
    of good behavior, rejection of malformed transactions, and strict verification
    of transactions and various other checks that are part of blockchain protocol.
    Therefore, even if an IoT device is somehow hacked, it would be treated as a Byzantine
    node by the blockchain network and would not cause any adverse impact on the network.

    contracts, and AAs will give rise to **Artificially Intelligent Decentralized
    Autonomous Organizations** (**AIDAOs**) that can act on behalf of humans to run
    entire organizations on their own. This is another side of AI that can become
    norm in the future. However, more research is required to realize this vision.

    virtual reality, augmented reality, and the gaming industry is also envisaged.
    For example, in a multiplayer online game, blockchain's decentralized approach
    allows for more transparency and can ensure that no central authority is gaining
    unfair advantage by manipulating the game rules. All these topics are active areas
    of research currently and more interest and development are expected in these
    areas soon.

    have implemented some pilot projects but large-scale production implementations
    are yet to be seen. It is expected that within year 2018 we will see some organization
    implementing full scale blockchain based projects. In 2019, it is expected that
