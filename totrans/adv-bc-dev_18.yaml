    ledger is specially developed for only one application in mind and is focused
    on a specific industry, for example, Everledger, ([https://www.everledger.io](https://www.everledger.io))
    which is a blockchain that has been developed to be used for providing an immutable
    tracing history and audit trail for diamonds and other high-value items. This
    approach thwarts any fraud attempts because everything related to ownership, authenticity,
    and value of the items is verified and recorded on the blockchain. This result

    think about the possibility of creating platforms that can provide guarantees
    and services which a blockchain provides but without the need for a blockchain.
    This has resulted in development of R3's Corda, which in fact is not really a
    blockchain because it is not based on the concept of blocks containing transactions;
    instead, it is based on the concept of a state object that transverses throughout
    the Corda network according to the requirements and rules of the network participants
    representing the latest state of the network. Other examples include IOTA, which
    is an IoT blockchain which makes use of a **Directed Acyclic Graph** (**DAG**)
    as a distributed ledger named Tangle, instead of conventional blockchain with
    blocks. This ledger is claimed to have addressed scalability issues along with
    high-level security which even protects against quantum computing based attacks.
    It should be noted that Bitcoin is also somewhat protected against quantum attacks
    because the quantum attacks can only work on exposed public keys which are only
    revealed on the blockchain if both send and receive transactions are made. If
    the public key is not revealed, which is the case in unused addresses or the addresses
    that may have only used to receive bitcoins, then quantum safety can be guaranteed.
    In other words, using a different address for each transaction protects against
    quantum attacks. Also, in Bitcoin, it is quite easy to change to another quantum
    signature protocol if required.

    IOTA，它是一个物联网区块链，使用有向无环图（DAG）作为名为 Tangle 的分布式分类帐，而不是传统的区块链与区块。据称，这个分类帐已经解决了可扩展性问题，同时具有高级别的安全性，甚至可以抵御基于量子计算的攻击。应该注意的是，比特币也在某种程度上受到量子攻击的保护，因为量子攻击只能针对暴露的公钥进行，而这些公钥仅在区块链上发送和接收交易时才会暴露。如果公钥没有被揭示，比如在未使用的地址或仅用于接收比特币的地址中，那么可以保证量子安全。换句话说，对于每个交易使用不同的地址可以保护免受量子攻击。此外，在比特币中，如果需要，很容易切换到另一个量子签名协议。

  zh: 一种解决方案可能是引入智能机器人、人工智能甚至内嵌有监管逻辑的合同。它们很可能是由监管机构和执法机构编程的，作为一种提供治理和控制的手段留存在区块链上。例如，可以设计区块链，使得每个智能合同都必须经过一个控制合同，该合同会审查代码逻辑并提供一种监管机制来控制智能合同的行为。
- en: It may also be possible to get each smart contract's code to be inspected by
    regulatory authorities, and once a smart contract code has a certain level of
    authenticity attached to it in the form of certificates issued by a regulator,
    it can be deployed on the blockchain network. This concept of binary signing is
    akin to the concept of the already established concept of code signing whereby
    executables are digitally signed as a means to confirm that the code is bona fide
    and is not malicious. This idea is more applicable in the context of semiprivate
    or regulated blockchains, where a certain degree of control is required by a regulatory
    authority, for example, in finance. It means that there is some degree of trust
    required to be placed in a trusted third party (regulator) which may not be desirable
    due to deviation from the concept of full decentralization. However, to address
    this, the blockchain itself can be used to provide a decentralized, transparent,
    and secure certificate issuance and digital signing mechanism.

    briefly, it is sufficient to say in this section that while some progress has
    already been made, still there is a need for more research to enable on-chain
    scalability and further improve off-chain solutions such as state channels. Some
    initiatives like block size increase and transaction-only blockchains (without
    blocks) have been proposed to address scalability issues that increase the capacity
    of the blockchain itself instead of using side channels. Examples of without blocks
    implementation include IOTA (Tangle). It is a DAG which is used to store transactions
    as compared to traditional blockchain solutions where a block is used to store
    transactions. This makes it inherently faster as compared to block-based blockchains
    such as Bitcoin where waiting time between block generations is at least approximately
    10 minutes.

    16](d0ef443d-d4b0-4afb-91f4-c5863ea1cf43.xhtml), *Scalability and Other Challenges*.
    Briefly, it can be said that due to the authenticity, integrity, privacy, and
    shared nature of blockchains, IoT networks will benefit greatly from blockchain
    technology. This can be realized in the form of an IoT network that runs on a
    blockchain and makes use of a decentralized mesh network for communication to
    facilitate **Machine-to-Machine** (**M2M**) communication in real time. All this
    data which is generated as a result of M2M communication can be used in the machine
    learning process to augment the functionality of Artificially Intelligent DAOs
    or simple AAs. AAs can act as agents in a **Distributed Artificial Intelligence**
    (**DAI**) environment provided by a blockchain and can learn over time using machine
    learning processes.

    DAO 或简单的 AAs 的功能。AAs 可以在区块链提供的**分布式人工智能**（**DAI**）环境中充当代理，并使用机器学习过程随时间学习。'
- en: AI is a field of computer science that endeavors to build intelligent agents
    that can make rational decisions based on the scenarios and environment that they
    observe around them. Machine learning plays a vital role in AI by making use of
    raw data as a learning resource. A key requirement in AI-based systems is the
    availability of authentic data that can be used for machine learning and model
    building. The explosion of data coming out IoT devices, smartphone's, and other
    data acquisition means that AI and machine learning is becoming more and more

  zh: AI 是计算机科学的一个领域，致力于构建可以根据其观察到的情景和环境做出理性决策的智能代理。机器学习通过利用原始数据作为学习资源，在 AI 中发挥着至关重要的作用。基于
    AI 的系统的一个关键要求是可用于机器学习和模型构建的真实数据。来自物联网设备、智能手机和其他数据采集手段的数据激增意味着人工智能和机器学习变得越来越强大。
- en: There is, however, a requirement of authenticity of data. Once consumers, producers,
    and other entities are on a blockchain, the data that is generated as a result
    of interaction between these entities can be readily used as an input to machine
    learning engines with a guarantee of authenticity. This is where AI converges
    with blockchains. It could be argued that if an IoT device is hacked, it can send
    malformed data to the blockchain. This issue is mitigated because an IoT device
    is part of the blockchain (as a node) and has all security properties applied
    to it as a standard node in the blockchain network. These properties include incentivization
    of good behavior, rejection of malformed transactions, and strict verification
    of transactions and various other checks that are part of blockchain protocol.
    Therefore, even if an IoT device is somehow hacked, it would be treated as a Byzantine
    node by the blockchain network and would not cause any adverse impact on the network.

  zh: 然而，数据的真实性是一个要求。一旦消费者、生产者和其他实体进入区块链，作为这些实体相互作用结果生成的数据可以立即作为机器学习引擎的输入，并具有真实性的保证。这就是人工智能与区块链融合的地方。可以说，如果物联网设备被黑客攻击，它可以向区块链发送格式错误的数据。这个问题得到缓解，因为物联网设备是区块链的一部分（作为节点），并且具有应用于区块链网络中标准节点的所有安全属性。这些属性包括激励良好行为、拒绝格式错误的交易以及对交易进行严格验证和各种其他检查，这些都是区块链协议的一部分。因此，即使物联网设备以某种方式被黑客攻击，它也将被区块链网络视为拜占庭节点，并且不会对网络造成任何不利影响。

    contracts, and AAs will give rise to **Artificially Intelligent Decentralized
    Autonomous Organizations** (**AIDAOs**) that can act on behalf of humans to run

    virtual reality, augmented reality, and the gaming industry is also envisaged.
    For example, in a multiplayer online game, blockchain's decentralized approach
    allows for more transparency and can ensure that no central authority is gaining
    unfair advantage by manipulating the game rules. All these topics are active areas
