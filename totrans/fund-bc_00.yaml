- en: 'Blockchain technology can be very intimidating when encountered for the first
    time. But in reality, the technology itself  is just a combination of three popular
    concepts: cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and game theory. Although these
    may seem complicated at first glance, a basic understanding of these three required
    concepts will help you to build a strong foundation that once you''ve completed,
    can be used as a cornerstone for understanding blockchain technology at an advanced
    level.'

- en: This book helps you to understand the concepts of blockchain technology, and
    introduces you to both cryptocurrency, as well as several blockchain platforms.
    It also gives an in-depth analysis of the potential and concerns of the technology
    so that blockchain can be adopted where its implementation actually adds value.
