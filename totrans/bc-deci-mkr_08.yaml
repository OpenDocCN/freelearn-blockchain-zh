    tokens and blockchains in terms of laws and tax across the globe at different
    levels of power in the states. It is important to note that every jurisdiction
    has its own degree of awareness, its own degree of ambition to control the technology
    and its assets, its own way to gather information, and its own manner to make
    a decision about the ecosystem. In this fashion, risks and opportunities regarding

    question: *What regulation should the blockchain project abide to? *The answer
    is rather local regarding the implementation of the project in a crypto-friendly
    or crypto-skeptic environment. Indeed, blockchain and cryptocurrencies are perceived
    very differently according to the region they are implemented in. It is important

    taken care of other regulations, such as data protection (**General Data Protection

    its report of investigation in July 2017 (one month after the DAO's failures)
    stating that DAO tokens should have been subject to security laws because they
    were labeled as such. This was one of the first initiatives toward regulating
    cryptoassets, at least in the US. The SEC advanced this immense task to a globally

- en: With this first initiative, the SEC triggered concerns from other institutions
    from overseas who started to pay attention to tokens and, more broadly to ICOs.
    It occurred to them that an ICO was financially disruptive because it allowed
    any project leader to raise funds quickly and costlessly, and for investors to
    invest directly and instantaneously in a project without paying fees to a venture
    capital firm, thus avoiding the current regulated funding scheme. Public institutions,
    associations, and authorities realized that there was work to undertake both to
    legally define the tokens issuance process as well as to protect the investors.
    Policies such as KYC and AML gained reinforcement to protect stakeholders from
    too risky and irresponsible investments and comply with regulatory bodies.

- en: Because security tokens really look like traditional shares, they fall into
    the scope of a much-regulated domain where issuance and marketing are examined
    as an investor's identities, the purpose of the funds, and the related risks.
    In this fashion, authorities became really concerned with alerting people and
    investors about the potential danger of investing in an ICO, especially in security
    tokens. The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority in Germany released a note

    the world. Switzerland has a very crypto-friendly attitude towards ICO and for
    accounting tokens without negatively affecting corporate tax. The city of Zug
    actually became the capital of the Crypto Valley, an ecosystem of blockchain entrepreneurs,
    startups, and incubators that attracted several famous blockchain companies, such
    as ConsenSys.

    (**ANC**), who published a paper in December 2018 indicating that some tokens
    must be recorded in the balance sheet as debt or as turnover according to their

  zh: 这项工作是由其他机构之前提出的疑问的结果。在澳大利亚，监督该国报告标准的**澳大利亚会计准则委员会**（**AASB**）于2016年12月向**国际会计准则委员会**（**IASB**）发送了一份文件（[https://www.aasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/AASB_ASAF_DigitalCurrency.pdf](https://www.aasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/AASB_ASAF_DigitalCurrency.pdf)），主张数字货币和其他无形资产需要更明确的标准。
- en: According to the AASB, cryptoassets shouldn't be considered as cash or cash
    equivalent, nor as financial instruments, because they do not represent a treasury
    flow in the financial statement (according to the IAS 7 norm definitions) and
    because there is no underlying contractual relationship. The AASB pointed out
    that, on the other hand, a cryptocurrency meets the definition of another norm,
    the IAS 38, stating that it should be considered as an intangible asset because
    it is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance.

  zh: 根据澳大利亚会计标准局（AASB）的说法，加密资产不应被视为现金或现金等价物，也不应被视为金融工具，因为它们不代表财务报表中的资金流动（根据IAS 7规定的定义），也因为没有基础合同关系。AASB指出，另一方面，加密货币符合另一项规定，即IAS
    38，规定它应被视为无形资产，因为它是一种可识别的非货币资产，没有实物。

- en: In this chapter, we started by understanding why, as a decision maker, it is
    important to take regulatory frameworks into consideration when launching a blockchain
    project, especially since 2017's hype that aroused public authorities' attention.
    Legal questions need to be addressed as there is more and more concerns from regulatory
    bodies towards blockchain. We established legal definitions on blockchain's terminology
    and neologism in order to fundamentally grasp what cryptoassets, cryptocurrencies,
    and tokens are in the eyes of the law. We ended this chapter by looking at the
    different initiatives that have been taken worldwide in terms of legality and
    accounting.
