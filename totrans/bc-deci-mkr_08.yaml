    that have to be adopted by a decision maker, but that would not be enough to secure
    a project. As the blockchain environment is fast-moving, many jurisdictions fail
    to frame cryptoassets and blockchains through laws and regulations properly. This
    chapter focuses on blockchains through the lens of legality, accounting, taxes,
    compliance, and regulations. We will legally define what a blockchain and a cryptocurrency
    is in the eyes of the law, and how this new technology and the digital assets
    it is generating have been handled by authorities worldwide. As a decision maker,
    you must be aware of the complex regulatory framework surrounding blockchain,

    by blockchain and cryptoassets until a global coordination is set to align regulations
    and taxonomy for a better and more comprehensive framework. For instance, in July
    2018, the **Financial Stability Board** (**FSB**), whose role is to establish
    and coordinate the work of national financial authorities at an international
    level, published a report ([http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P160718-1.pdf](http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P160718-1.pdf)) in
    response to the G20 that the Ministers of Finance held a few months earlier. This
    report identified metrics for monitoring the financial stability implications
    of cryptoasset markets, introduced support for ICO investors, and measured the
    exposure to cryptoassets that banks faced.

    tokens and blockchains in terms of laws and tax across the globe at different
    levels of power in the states. It is important to note that every jurisdiction
    has its own degree of awareness, its own degree of ambition to control the technology
    and its assets, its own way to gather information, and its own manner to make
    a decision about the ecosystem. In this fashion, risks and opportunities regarding
    a project's perimeter will mainly depend on the territory in which it is implemented.

    whose answers will mostly depend on external factors such as the jurisdiction
    and territory, but also on internal factors such as the sector, business size,
    and target clients. For instance, there is no universal answer to the following
    question: *What regulation should the blockchain project abide to? *The answer
    is rather local regarding the implementation of the project in a crypto-friendly
    or crypto-skeptic environment. Indeed, blockchain and cryptocurrencies are perceived
    very differently according to the region they are implemented in. It is important
    to note that the main concerns from authorities and institutions are not toward
    blockchain itself but rather the assets that it is generating, that is, the so-called
    tokens tied to the blockchain.'

    Then comes the question of how to handle tax issues such as benefits for R&D tax
    reduction and, more importantly, issues regarding the accountability and depreciation
    of the blockchain project. Several countries have significantly advanced cryptoassets
    accounting in financial statements and made such topics a real concern for many
    companies. Eventually, a compliant blockchain project is also a project that has
    taken care of other regulations, such as data protection (**General Data Protection
    Regulation** (**GDPR**) in the European Union), a customers' identity (**Know
    Your Customer** (**KYC**) policy), and criminality prevention (**Anti Money Laundering**

    suitable definitions regarding the neologism surrounding the ecosystem, such as
    *token*, *cryptocurrency* or *cryptoasset*, in order to qualify them properly.
    What exactly should we understand when we're talking about a token, a digital
    asset, or a cryptocurrency? What does it mean for authorities and institutions
    now that value can be transferred digitally without replication? In the end, by
    stating the definition of these terms, we can restrict their meaning and eventually
    apply rules and laws.

    to establish a legal framework and general guidelines. Since the DAO failed to
    see this (see [Chapter 4](14ee5341-fb0e-4544-8ec0-038684605664.xhtml), *ICOs and
    Tokenized Fundraising Methods*), the US SEC undertook efforts to fit the new asset
    class into US laws.
  prefs: []

    US SEC into defining tokens as financial securities or utilities. The SEC released
    its report of investigation in July 2017 (one month after the DAO's failures)
    stating that DAO tokens should have been subject to security laws because they
    were labeled as such. This was one of the first initiatives toward regulating
    cryptoassets, at least in the US. The SEC advanced this immense task to a globally
    agreed perspective on tokens and gave out a starting point for categorizing them
    using the Howey test in order to determine the classification of a cryptoasset.

    from overseas who started to pay attention to tokens and, more broadly to ICOs.
    It occurred to them that an ICO was financially disruptive because it allowed
    any project leader to raise funds quickly and costlessly, and for investors to
    invest directly and instantaneously in a project without paying fees to a venture
    capital firm, thus avoiding the current regulated funding scheme. Public institutions,
    associations, and authorities realized that there was work to undertake both to
    legally define the tokens issuance process as well as to protect the investors.
    Policies such as KYC and AML gained reinforcement to protect stakeholders from
    too risky and irresponsible investments and comply with regulatory bodies.

    the scope of a much-regulated domain where issuance and marketing are examined
    as an investor's identities, the purpose of the funds, and the related risks.
    In this fashion, authorities became really concerned with alerting people and
    investors about the potential danger of investing in an ICO, especially in security
    tokens. The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority in Germany released a note
    in June 2017, as well as the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom
    in April 2018, to investors regarding risks related to investing in ICOs.
