    inefficiencies and costs in industries such as financial services, supply chains,
    logistics, and healthcare. Blockchain's key features include immutability and
    a shared ledger where transactional updates are performed by a consensus-driven
    trust system, which can facilitate a truly digital interaction between multiple
    parties.

- en: This digital interaction is not only bound by systemic trust, but ensures that
    the provenance of the transactional record maintains an immutable track record
    of interaction between parties. This very characteristic lends itself to culpability
    and non-repudiation, and incentivizes fair play. With the blockchain system design,
    we are attempting to build a system that has implied trust. This trust system
    leads to reduced risks, and various applied technology constructs such as a cryptography,
    encryption, smart contracts, and consensus essentially create gates to not only
    reduce risk but to also infuse added security into the transaction system.

- en: At a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger for
    recording transactions, maintained within a distributed network of mutually untrusting
    peers. Every peer maintains a copy of the ledger. The peers execute a consensus
    protocol to validate transactions, group them into blocks, and build a hash chain
    over the blocks. This process forms the ledger by ordering the transactions as
    is necessary for consistency. Blockchain has emerged with bitcoin ([http:// bitcoin.org/](https://bitcoin.org/en/))
    and is widely regarded as a promising technology to run trusted exchanges in the
    digital world.

    sense that anyone can participate without a specific identity. Such blockchains
    typically use a consensus protocol based on **proof of work** (**PoW**) and economic
    incentives. In contrast, permissioned blockchains have evolved as an alternative
    way to run a blockchain between a group of known, identified participants. A permissioned
    blockchain provides a way to secure interactions between a group of entities who
    share a mutual goal but don't fully trust each other, such as businesses that
    exchange funds, goods, or information. A permissioned blockchain relies on the
    identities of its peers, and in so doing can use the traditional **Byzantine-fault
    tolerant** (**BFT**) consensus. BFT is a protocol that has been widely used in
    IT solutions to reach a consensus on the state of faulty nodes of a network. This
    protocol is based on the Byzantine General's Problem, whereby a group of general
    need to reach a consensus on their strategy but one of them maybe treacherous.

    of a blockchain solution. The fundamental security of the bitcoin blockchain is
    the elegant cryptographical linkage of all major components of the ledger. Specifically,
    transactions are linked to each other, mainly through the Merkle tree.  A Merkle
    tree is based on the concept of a tree data structure where every leaf node has
    a hash calculated of its data and where the non-leaf node have a hash of all of
    their underlying child. This method provides a way to ensure the integrity of
    the data, but also provides privacy characteristics by allowing one to remove
    a leaf that is deemed private but leave the hash, thereby preserving the integrity
    of the tree. The Merkle tree has its roots incorporated into the block header.
    The block header includes a reference to the block headers that precede it.

    header, hence providing no connectivity to the rest of the blockchain. If we proceed
    to change the Merkle tree root in the block's header, we will in turn break the
    chain of headers and thus the security model of the blockchain itself. Therefore,
    if we only change the contents of a block, the rest of the blockchain components
    remain stable and secure, especially as the block headers provide the connecting
    links by including a hash of the previous block header in the header of the next
    block.

    instead, each blockchain node (or peer) has an equal say in establishing the order,
    by implementing the network consensus protocol. Consensus consequently ensures
    that a quorum of nodes agree on the order in which transactions are appended to
    the shared ledger. Consensus, by resolving discrepancies in the proposed transaction
    order, helps guarantee that all network nodes are operating on an identical blockchain.
    In other words, it guarantees both the integrity and consistency of transactions
    in a blockchain network.

    essential business systems. By working with many enterprises, I've found that

    redundant and duplicate systems and processes. These duplications cost an organization
    significant resources, leading to slower transaction processing and associated
    opportunity costs. One goal with blockchain adoption should be to address the
    central pain point of the existing process. The aspiration is for a transparent

    network has sustainable operational elements and business growth elements. For
    example, in a sustainable model, every participant could deploy the chaincode
    that governs its own business process as it accepts and deals with digital assets,
    while also putting business participants in control of changing business processes,
    policies, and regulatory requirements.

    various NoSQL systems solved their problems by understanding this CAP theorem,
    and the RDBMS enterprise community held steadfast to their ACID properties. Blockchain
    might well provide the primitives to break CAP and maintain ACID. Here are some
    thoughts.

    hypervisors, and Docker container images cannot be modified. Certificates may
    be included in the SSC so that they can probe themselves into being genuine to
    a remote a party. For example, including an SSL certificate when building SSCs
    helps ensure that you're speaking with a genuine instance, since the SSL certificate
    always stays protected (encrypted) within the SSC.

- en: According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module),
    a **hardware security module** (**HSM**) is a physical computing device that safeguards
    and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides cryptoprocessing.
    These modules traditionally come in the form of a plugin card or an external device
    that attaches directly to a computer or network server.

    in relation to sufficient security and controls. In fact, today's standards mandate
    certain methods and levels of security for HSM administrative (and key management)
    systems.

    will not only have to run, manage, and maintain their existing infrastructure;
    they'll also need to help pave the way for this new computational model that promises
    to bring transformation.

- en: In regulated industries, organizations could face a dual impact on the cost
    of compliance, since even a new technology platform still needs to adhere to established
    regulatory frameworks and proven technology architecture standards and design.
    Enterprises considering blockchain can look towards a pragmatic approach by adopting
    a doctrine of layered defense, combining multiple mitigating security controls
    to help protect their resources and data. With the layered defense approach, digital
    assets/smart contracts as well as ledger data will be guarded.
