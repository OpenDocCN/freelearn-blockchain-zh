    (**EVM**) and blockchain technology, but with a few key changes. First, instead
    of using the proof-of-work consensus algorithm used by the public Ethereum chain,
    Burrow is designed around the Tendermint consensus algorithm (See [Chapter 7](7f407309-5d34-464d-90fb-7d563834b8f8.xhtml), *Achieving
    Consensus*). This means there are no miners and no mining to be done on Burrow-based
    projects.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 超级账本Burrow是以太坊虚拟机（**EVM**）和区块链技术的重新实现，但有一些关键变化。首先，Burrow不使用公共以太坊链使用的工作量证明共识算法，而是设计围绕Tendermint共识算法（参见[第7章](7f407309-5d34-464d-90fb-7d563834b8f8.xhtml)，*实现共识*）。这意味着在基于Burrow的项目中没有矿工，也没有挖矿活动。
- en: Second, Hyperledger Burrow is permissioned—the computers allowed to participate
    in a Hyperledger Burrow network are known and granted access, and the computers
    signing blocks (called **validators**, as in Tendermint) are all known. This is
    very different than Ethereum, where anyone can anonymously download the Ethereum
    software and join the network.

  zh: 其次，超级账本Burrow是许可的——允许参与超级账本Burrow网络的计算机是已知的并获得授权的，而签署块的计算机（称为**验证者**，如Tendermint中的）也都是已知的。这与以太坊非常不同，任何人都可以匿名下载以太坊软件并加入网络。
- en: Smart contracts written for the EVM will still mostly work. Due to the change
    in consensus, there are also changes in the way Gas is used. In the public Ethereum
    blockchain, each transaction costs Gas, depending on the complexity of the transaction,
    and each block has a Gas limit. Depending on the network load, participants have
    to pay a variable cost in Ether for the Gas needed for their transactions. In
    Burrow, these complexities are mostly dispensed with. Each transaction is gifted
    a basic amount of Gas automatically. Because the Gas is still limited, Burrow
    is able to guarantee that all transactions eventually complete—either by succeeding
    or failing—because they run out of Gas.
  id: totrans-19

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 为EVM编写的智能合约仍然大部分能够工作。由于共识的改变，Gas的使用方式也有所改变。在公共以太坊区块链中，每笔交易都要根据交易的复杂性付出Gas的代价，并且每个区块都有一个Gas限制。根据网络负载的不同，参与者必须支付Ether的可变成本来获取所需的Gas。在Burrow中，这些复杂性大多被摒弃了。每笔交易都自动获得一定数量的Gas。由于Gas仍然是有限的，Burrow能够保证所有交易最终完成——要么成功，要么因为Gas耗尽而失败。

    going first. Because the code to generate the wait time is in the TEE, it can
    be verified that each node is running appropriate code and not skipping in line
    to become leader by not waiting the amount of time generated by the random time
    generator. Therefore, the election of the leader (and block issuer) is very fast,
    which in turn allows the blockchain to operate quickly.

    the application layer is highly configurable. Each Sawtooth-based blockchain allows
    transactions to be made based on what are called **transaction families**. Transaction
    families determine what sorts of operations are permissible on the Sawtooth blockchain.
    For instance, it is possible to allow smart contracts, such as with Ethereum,
    using the **Seth** transaction family. Under Seth, all possible Ethereum-based
    contracts and Ethereum contract-based transactions would be permissible, along
    with all the possible mistakes and issues such freedom creates.

    at once. In fact, this is common, as one of the transaction families that ships
    with Sawtooth is the settings family, which stores system-wide configuration settings
    directly on to the blockchain. In most cases, this transaction family and a few
    others, comprised of business use cases, will be operating in parallel. Furthermore,
    because multiple transaction families can be running at the same time, this means
    that business logic can be isolated and reused as an independent transaction family
    across multiple blockchain implementations.

- en: 'Because many businesses have only a few valid business rules and business outcomes,
    it is possible to customize the available operations on the blockchain through
    the creation of a custom transaction family. For instance, a shipping company
    may use Sawtooth to track the location of packages, and the only valid transactions
    might be new package, package accepted, package released, package in transit,
    update package location, and package delivered. By restricting the available transactions,
    the number of errors and mistakes can be reduced. Using the shipping company example,
    network participants could be trucking companies, warehouses, and so on. For a
    package to move between a truck and a warehouse, the two network participants
    would issue package released and package accepted transactions, respectively,
    in a batch on to the blockchain. This brings us to the next concept in Sawtooth:

    an in-memory structure on a computer to a fixed binary that can be sent across
    the network. No matter what the language is, the approach to serialization must
    have the same output. In Sawtooth, all transactions and batches are encoded in
    a format called **protocol buffers**, a format created by Google internally, and

    validated identities and join the blockchain by using a **Membership Service Provider**

    organizations provides each of their peers a signed digital certificate proving
    their membership of a certain organization. This certificate then allows each

    A private channel allows a subset of members on a Fabric-based blockchain to create
    a new blockchain that is observable and intractable only for them. This means
    that, while Fabric is already private and permissioned, members of that private
    blockchain can create a smaller, yet more exclusive, chain to trade information
    that cannot be traded across the full membership network. As a result, Fabric
    is able to support critical use cases (such as legal communications) that would
    be impossible or inappropriate to broadcast, even on a relatively exclusive network.

    be a number of shipping providers, materials providers, and a set of buyers. A
    buyer could issue to the blockchain a notice that they were accepting bids for
    a transfer of some supplies, and they could then create private channels between
    themselves and all transporters and suppliers. The suppliers and shipping companies
    could give the buyer time and cost prices, without making that information public
    to their competitors. While private, all of these exchanges would be encoded on
    to the blockchain for record keeping, legal compliance, and so on. Moreover, if

    Ethereum, chaincode is not embedded directly inside the ledger itself. Instead,
    chaincode is installed on each peer node and interacts with the ledger to read
    and update state information about the assets the chaincode controls. Because
    the chaincode is signed and approved by all peers, and because each peer that
    uses a piece of chaincode must validate any state changes on the ledger, this
    system still allows distributed and trusted consensus, using smart contracts.
    To provide consistency, chaincode itself runs in an isolated Docker container.

    to create a new token type on Iroha, it takes just a single command—`crt_ast`.
