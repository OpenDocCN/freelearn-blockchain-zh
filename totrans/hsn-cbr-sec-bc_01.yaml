    success. Information is usually created when a series of high-volume and unarguable
    data is used to answer a simple question. Intelligence is developed by collecting
    information to present a forecast that can be used for decision making processes.
    Intelligence gathering is the most powerful and effective practice to predict
    the future. From ancient intelligence to today's artificial intelligence, from
    the world wars to today's cyberwar, the goal is always to be a step ahead of our
    adversaries.

    Liberation Army** (**PLA**), have been accused of stealing technology and trade
    secrets, often from private institutes in the US. You may think that China wants
    to destroy the US, but that's not true. China simply wants to be the superpower
    and wants to be a technology leader. Eventually, it wants every single American,
    and even the rest of the world, to be technology-dependent on the Chinese market
    place. This results in a continuous attempt of Chinese spying operations targeting
    multinational businesses and government institutes to gather trade secrets. Let's
    switch gears now. Political parties keep gathering information through advanced
    analytics from their own citizens to predict the upcoming election results. It
    is clear that the world is changing with the changes in the internet.

    are now managing most critical assets of organizations; however, the increasing
    number of interconnected applications and technologies also result in an increase

    security measures to locate and fix such security vulnerabilities; however, this
    is a never-ending job for security forces. Nevertheless, top vulnerabilities can

    mindset at a fundamental level. One of the most popular technologies named after
    the internet is the **blockchain**; however, what makes the blockchain truly revolutionary
    is its potential for applications beyond cryptocurrencies. Today, there are numerous
    startups that are using blockchain technology to disrupt existing business models
    and industry verticals such as cloud hosting, financial services, the supply chain,
    healthcare, cybersecurity, and many more. This book will be useful for security
    experts, security product engineers, and even blockchain enthusiasts. This book
    focuses on taking readers on a tour of the current security threat landscape and
    is a practical approach for overcoming some of the most critical security challenges
    with the blockchain technology.

    for continuous security innovation and operations. In the world of connected vehicles,
    IoT, and mobility and the cloud, it opens up a focal point for cybercrime, targeted
    attacks, and industrial espionage. Once an attacker finds a vulnerability and
    determines how to access an application, they have everything they need to build
    an exploit for the application, and so it is critical to develop strong vulnerability
    management. Remember, the effectiveness of vulnerability management depends on
    the organization's strength to keep up with emerging security threats and models.

    amount of media coverage in the past two years, mainly because of WannaCry, NotPetya,

    Tor browser basically routes the user information through a series of proxy servers

    Europe. The Trojan was targeting SD cards slotted into tablets and handsets, automatically
    crawling the entire set to get certain files and then demanding cash to decrypt
    the data. The virus entered the devices through the Google Play Store. Once installed,
    the virus would scan the affected device for various file types and encrypted
    those using an **Advanced Encryption Standard** (**AES**), changing the file extensions
    to `.enc`. It also used to collect various other information from the respective
    device, such as the IMEI number, device model, and manufacturer, and sent this
    to a C2 server. With the latest versions of this virus, hackers can even access
    the device camera and display a picture of the victims to scare them into paying
    the ransom. This threat is still lurking out there.

    is important that government authorities become better at protecting their critical
    assets.

    such as **Bring Your Own Device** (**BYOD**) make the probability and score of
    insider threats even higher. Even after spending millions of dollars over preventive
    security, it still never gives complete assurance, and this has made organizations
    explore various emerging security defense technologies to detect and combat advance
    threats that are successful in bypassing existing security systems. In many multinational
    organizations, the **Chief Information Security Officer** (**CISO**) has got multiple

    can detect the attackers and gather an insight into their behavior and artifacts,
    which will then help improve their defense. This can be extended with multilevel

    Adversaries are changing their weapons and tactics in regards to the changes in
    technology and business processes, and with this, defenders are aggressively exploring
    various security tools. It is also clear that attackers do not need to be sophisticated
    to perform a sophisticated data breach; they simply have to be opportunists. With

    actors are able to discover assets and their corresponding vulnerabilities.
