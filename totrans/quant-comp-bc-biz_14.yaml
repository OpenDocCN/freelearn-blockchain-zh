    Nations waged war upon one another for access to resources that would make them
    more powerful. During World War II, Hitler's invasion of the Caucasus was one
    such instance, with him going after the rich oil resources there. Winston Churchill's
    strategic push in North Africa was to hold key port cities in the region so that
    he could have access to India, which was then a British colony.

    in the second half of the century. However, geopolitical issues are slowly starting
    to move away from depleting resources such as oil or iron ore, to a resource that
    keeps growing despite consumption – data. By 2025, the world is expected to be
    175 zettabytes rich, of which about 90 ZB will be from the **Internet of Things**
    (**IoT**).

    data, financial data, healthcare data, and the personal data of citizens. Therefore,
    it is important to understand how they intend to leverage technology to gain data
    supremacy. There was a time during the Cold War when there was an arms race between
    the superpowers as to who had more nuclear warheads.

    as quantum computing, Blockchain, and AI. Therefore, when we discuss these technologies,
    it is important to understand the role they would play in cyber wars that nations
    would want to dominate. Therefore, when I was looking at thought leaders to interview
    for the book, I knew I needed to get an expert in this space. Dinesh Nagarajan,
    Executive Partner and Global Competency Leader at IBM, was certainly one of them.

    security propositions for banks and I was focused on Chief Data Officer advisory
    propositions. He joined IBM in 2016 and has gone from strength to strength. Dinesh
    shares his insights on cyber risks and how technology and the explosion of data
    has made us vulnerable. He stresses that it is not just technology that can help
    us with cyber risks. We will also need to ensure there is awareness around cyber
    risks and the controls available to protect ourselves at all levels of society.

    of technology innovation on data security and privacy. He is able to understand
    and stay on top of technology capabilities that exist with different stakeholders
    in the cyber landscape. However, he is also able to apply that understanding to
    the context of cyber wars and cyber risk management. Both Dinesh and I enjoyed
    the process of this interview, and I hope you find it useful too.

    helped me get a global view of the cyber security world. I get to see how clients
    approach this space, not just from a technical lens, but from a process, awareness,

    technological advancements across most industries. This is the fifth wave of industrial
    revolution. I think the speed and the pace of change has been phenomenal. Most
    industries in this period have gone through digitization that transformed previously
    manual processes and services into digital equivalents. This is often accompanied
    by data exchange and interactions digitally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    have never been exposed outside the data center. These systems can be mobile applications,
    web applications, or social media. There is a fundamental change in the way organizations
    want to service their clients. There is a demand and a change in the way customers
    consume services these days. There is a demand to deliver services quicker. There
    is an "always-on" requirement that customers would like to leverage at any point
    of time, all the time, 24/7\.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    organizations to be very agile and to be able to respond to these asks. Therefore,
    the most important interface to the client today is digital. Be it financial services,
    logistics, healthcare, or any other critical service we need, we have started
    to rely on and trust digital means more than legacy ways of doing things.

    social media. The next wave of interactions will not just be between customers
    and these interfaces, but also between machines. There is a prediction that there
    will be more than 50 billion devices on the IoT in the next 5 years. The other
    interesting prediction on the data side is that even the smallest organization
    will produce 20 times more data in the next 3 years than what they're producing
    today. These numbers are staggering.

    cloud. A move to the cloud shouldn't be viewed as just technology transformation.
    There is also business transformation involved. Let's take FinTech for instance.
    FinTech is driving traditional banks to adapt to new business models and ways
    of servicing. As data is being hosted on cloud infrastructure, and shared using
    open banking, we see new business opportunities for third-party solutions that
    can leverage this data. Oftentimes, banks can themselves create these solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The move to the cloud is also changing the typical traditional IT ecosystem.
    Previously, most critical applications and services were hosted in a secure data
    center. Now they are deployed on a public cloud, interconnected with third-party
    services. Therefore, as these transitions and transformations are in progress,
    the prediction is that cyber-attacks are going to increase in the next 3 years.
    It is not just the number of cyber-attacks, but the intensity and the sophistication
    of the attacks will also increase. We will need to be prepared for that.

    They have automated and orchestrated methods for breaking into a client's infrastructure.
    Once they have broken into the infrastructure, they are able to very quickly get
    to the target system. This is the kind of level of sophistication that threat
    actors have developed. But unfortunately, not all organizations have been able
    to match up in detecting and responding to cyber-attacks with the same level of sophistication.

    But there is still a lot more to be done. You must have heard about the ransomware
    attack on a global shipping liner, one of the biggest shipping companies in the
    world. One morning, the company's laptops had messages with red and black lettering.
    Employees were asked to pay in bitcoins to recover their files. Restarting laptops
    took them back to that screen.

    laptops and disconnect from the network. About 49,000 laptops and 3,500 of the
    6,200 servers were affected. The attack caused so much disruption that even their
    IT teams were helpless at the time. It brought the entire firm to a standstill
    for about 9 days, when the recovery of 2,000 laptops got them back into business.
    This is a firm whose ship hits a port in the world every 15 minutes, with most
    ships being able to carry 20,000 containers. If such a large company can be a
    victim of cyber-attacks, it is hard to fathom how smaller organizations can cope.

    the biggest of organizations. Therefore, it's no longer a case of just installing
    antivirus software and assuming you are safe from virus attacks; cyber security
    is much bigger than that. Many of the organizations I talk to understand that
    a sophisticated attack could cripple them for days and weeks and plan around that.
    However, there are several organizations that are perhaps in denial about the
    dangers of this threat.

    in August 2019\. I visited a temple with my family. When I walked out of the temple,
    there was a woman selling flowers, and she had a QR code printout hanging on her
    little mobile stall, which we used to pay. It is unlikely that this lady understood
    cyber security. She understood that money was reaching her bank account digitally,

    state hackers. Therefore, the country's growth from a consumer side has opened
    it up to new vulnerabilities. Public sector officials are going on to the internet
    with no clue about these cyber risks. Therefore, there is a massive awareness
    problem, especially in emerging markets. What are your thoughts around this?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    regulatory bodies should also step in here. They need to enforce basic safeguards
    that service providers should be able to provide, to protect the rural population;
    a liability model that could be established between the customers and the service
    providers, which will force them to provide cyber safeguards. I think there is
    a definite role for regulatory bodies and governments across these growth markets.
    While you''re creating new avenues of services and new ways of delivering business
    value to consumers, you also need to provide the necessary guardrails.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    safeguarding mechanisms for the end consumer, trust in the digital space will
    very quickly evaporate. Losing customer trust can be detrimental to the whole
    industry. As a result, consumers can stop buying things from a particular service
    provider because they are more vulnerable to cyber threats. Consumers could even stop
    transacting from their mobile phones if they completely lose trust for their internet providers.

    The entire digital economy and financial inclusion story may end up being a house

    to protect the vulnerable consumer.

    no single technology (today) that we can rely on to solve this problem. The other
    key point to think about is that technology keeps changing very fast. 10 years
    back, as long as you had a secure username and password you considered yourself
    secure. It is no longer the case and things have moved on quite a bit from that.
    Security has moved on from there to focusing on protecting infrastructure, the
    operating system, and the application. It has moved up the stack starting from
    the infrastructure. However, now the focus is on data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the new world, organizations don't even own their infrastructure anymore.
    If you are planning to host your data or your applications in the cloud, you don't
    own the infrastructure, and you don't own the platforms or the operating systems.
    Therefore, you just need to focus on protecting your data and your clients' data.
    As a result of this spotlight on data protection, there is more of a focus on,
    and investments are moving toward, data protection. Consequently, there is more
    of a focus on data encryption, and there are various ways of doing data encryption.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is encryption, tokenization, data masking, and several new realms of identity
    and access management. Biometric identity and access management is a key aspect
    for data security. Having your security control literally where the data resides
    rather than on the infrastructure or the operating system layer is considered
    critical. In doing so, you are basically protecting data as it moves around these
    different tiers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    We will need to build in authentication and authorization capabilities to protect
    data using clear data security models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also have "shift left" security practices that are becoming more mainstream
    now, where security controls are built into applications at an early stage of
    the development cycle. Therefore, the application is secured by design. While
    these measures are largely there to prevent an attack or unauthorized access to
    data, you are still going to expect a certain small percentage of attacks to get
    through these controls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a data breach happens for whatever reasons, you still need the capability
    to detect, respond, and mitigate very quickly. The ability to act quickly against
    an attack and keep servicing your customers is called resilience. This has now
    matured into a space where it is no longer just a technical problem but is also
    a business problem. It is not just about how much data has been breached, and
    how you can fix it technically. It is also about how many clients have been affected
    by the data breach, whether they still have access to your services, and whether
    you can continue services for those clients. Therefore, beyond technology, business
    resilience takes center stage in the new world we live in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's go back to the example of the shipping company, which had tens of thousands
    of desktops, and its network, affected by ransomware. For Maersk, resilience would
    mean having the ability to continue getting their ships to hit the target ports
    on time and delivering containers despite the attack. The technical team in the
    background will perform forensics around the attack, fix the vulnerability in
    their system, and try to bring their computers, servers, and their networks up.
    However, the critical thing is being able to operate in the absence of all of
    this digital support.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Coming back to your question, in the shipping company example, technology may
    have prevented the attack. But it is changing at such a pace that organizations
    will often need to resort to operational resilience in the face of such attacks.
    One other thing I find lacking in the industry is a collaborative mechanism of
    sharing intelligence about a coordinated attack.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think that is an effective way of preventing cyber-attacks at scale, because,
    once there is intelligence about the modus operandi of the attackers, they are
    forced to rethink. They will have to go back to the drawing board to launch another
    attack. There are initiatives in the UK and in Europe in some industries to share
    intelligence about cyber-attacks. But there needs to be more intelligence-sharing
    as the risks are not just limited to these developed parts of the world.

    a lot of hype around cutting edge technologies like quantum [computing] and its

    trouble once quantum computers become mainstream.'

    about the risks and opportunities of some emerging technologies, but not to the
    extent that I would ideally like to see. There is interest in understanding the
    risk for asymmetric cryptography from emerging technologies. In the last year,
    we have done some work with clients in this space. Most of the organizations who
    are most interested are in the financial services industry. We have also spoken
    to a few automobile companies about security mechanisms as some of these emerging
    technologies go mainstream.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    once in 7 to 8 years, typically. Every time they have to make changes to their
    technology or infrastructure stack, the cycle of change lasts about 7 to 8 years'
    time. That timeframe is what is concerning them, because they think that in 7
    to 8 years' time some of these emerging technologies could become a reality. Therefore,
    even if they identified a solution to help with readiness on cyber security, it
    may not happen in time to face the threat.
  prefs: []

    a self-driving automobile system, will be exposed. Many of these firms have started
    to think, plan, and also socialize this risk with their boards. Now from an IBM
    standpoint, we feel that in order for you to protect yourself from these new technology
    paradigms, you need to go through a maturity journey. You can't start planning
    for it today and fix it tomorrow, because these technologies are still evolving,
    and by the time you think you have a fix, it is perhaps already outdated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The mitigation against cyber risks that these technologies will pose will come
    from increased awareness and agility. We use the term crypto agility to refer
    to how easily you can migrate from one cryptographic technique to another. Therefore,
    you need to keep your technology stack agile enough to adopt different cryptographic
    techniques that can help you defend your systems against a cyber-attack.

    some of these emerging technologies. Theoretically, we could keep our information
    safe from external attacks. However, it is too early to say if that would be a
    viable solution as the technology is still evolving. I think firms planning to
    combat the threats from emerging technologies will need to go through a maturity
    journey.

    the risks are. Once the risks to their systems and infrastructure are understood,
    they will need to go through a planning phase. The planning phase will involve
    how the cryptographic landscape can be improved. There needs to be a detailed
    assessment of how their infrastructure, applications, and processes can become
    crypto-agile.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    prepared for the new wave in computing. In the next few years, it will become
    increasingly clear as to what part of your crypto landscape is secure and what
    isn't. A crypto-agile architecture should then help swap and change areas that
    are assessed as being vulnerable in the new era.

    security during the design phase, the output of the product would be far better
    than what it is today.'

    to consider data security when they are adopting DevOps. There needs to be security
    design principles mandated when developers start building applications. They think
    about how their application will behave for the users when it goes into production.
    However, they often fail to think about how secure their application will be when
    it is rolled out into production.

    want to address data security holistically. Organizations are starting to understand
    security risks better and are trying to mitigate them. In order to do that, some
    of them have tried to do risk assessment and, more importantly, risk quantification.
    One of the often-repeated challenges in cyber security is risk quantification.
    It is quite hard for organizations to quantify their cyber risks.

    effectively. Where organizations adopt cyber risk frameworks to drive better maturity
    and therefore quantify these risks, they are better prepared. As cyber security
    experts within organizations are able to quantify the risks, they are able to
    speak the language the board of the firm will understand. They are therefore able
    to have a discussion at the highest level, where the impact is well understood
    and therefore well addressed.

    on. You mentioned that you now work with clients across the world. At the start
    of this decade, we had a geopolitical scenario between Iran and the US. While
    the US used traditional defense and military mechanisms, Iran basically indicated
    that they might resort to a cyber-attack. Since then, the US has been ramping
    up its activities to protect the country from cyber-attacks. There are also reports
    that there is a possibility for the electricity grid in the US to be attacked

    – cyber war. So, what are your thoughts on that?

    been going on for a while now across industries, across the world. Every time
    there is a sanction from the United Nations, folks in cyberspace would expect
    a wave of attacks that they need to be prepared for. I don''t see that trend changing.
    You can call this some sort of a cyber-arms race that''s going on in the background,
    which is not very visible to the public. The race is based on who''s got the technology,

    will know the vulnerabilities and the weaknesses in the IoT ecosystem, and this
    information is not disclosed. They'll retain that information so that they can
    leverage it as and when they want. Therefore, nation states that have developed
    sophisticated cyber capabilities do not suddenly become active or plan for an
    attack. In any sense, they are always active in the background.

    some nation states proactively orchestrate weaknesses in enemy territory. They
    will deliberately introduce backdoor weaknesses of a certain type that they can
    always leverage and use when the time is right. So, they've been constantly active,
    and I think this is going to be the unfortunate case in the future, and a case
    that we should be able to deal with.

    that may be targets, but they can also pull off an attack or breach private companies.
    We may also need to look at this risk through a different lens. How many such
    nation states would be bold enough to attack another country's critical infrastructure,
    resulting in a large loss of life or massive public disruption? I'm not sure that
    will happen.

    what they may typically target. I do not believe that a large-scale attack to
    destabilize an entire country and bring it to its knees is something on the cards.

    capable of such attacks operate under the radar and it is not easily possible
    to see and track them. I think their biggest concern is to be identified as someone
    behind a cyber-attack that cripples an enemy nation. Nobody wants to be there.
    So, I think that's one of the driving factors in them operating completely in
    the dark and under the radar.

    possibility that someone with a technological breakthrough could take on the entire

    stakeholders investing billions in this space to get ahead. For some, it is the
    data security advantage that the technology is going to give. For others, it is
    the ability to process information better and faster. There are several use cases
    of these emerging technologies that are not just focused on breaking traditional
    cryptography.'

    technology are being made with a view to playing a dominant role in cyber wars.
    A breakthrough in this technology could lead to a new global balance of power.

    even know if these countries will publicize it. While all indicators are that
    a breakthrough is still a few years away, it might have happened already. Nobody
    really knows how the landscape is going to change tomorrow. It's a very fascinating
    space. I also feel that more organizations could get involved in the R&D efforts
    of this technology. I think it is important to create a community that is moving
    toward a common good through their efforts to innovate.

    of the crowd there. They have invested several billion dollars into quantum science.
    The US is just catching up. In the last 10 years or so, about 70% of successful
    patents within the quantum space have been from China, and second in that list
    is the US with just 12%.'

    in this technology. Let''s take the way Linux was developed, for instance. It
    was a community-driven effort, and it has democratized the operating system space.
    On a similar note, I hope we have wider participation in the innovation around
    emerging technologies that will make them more viable for mainstream users. We
    may soon have an internet that leverages these emerging technologies.'

    around the technology, it would de-risk the whole world. Decentralized research
    and development efforts coming from across the world will definitely help reduce
    cyber risks. Hopefully, we won't end up having a superpower due to their emerging
    technology and information advantage.

    unfair that technological supremacy could result in a superpower nation or organization.
    That is especially true when it comes to quantum computing. However, there are
    several aspects of quantum computing that are being researched across the world.
    Therefore, I genuinely hope we will have several superpowers, each taking the
    lead on one aspect of quantum technology.

    be an enviable position. China has definitely taken the lead when it comes to
    quantum communication. Their quantum satellite experiments have put them ahead
    of the pack. However, there is still much to be achieved in quantum computing.
    There are challenges when quantum particles are used to transmit information or
    model problems. Some of these roadblocks need to be addressed to gain complete
    dominance through quantum technology breakthroughs.

    of cyber security in a world that is innovating in a massive hurry. Despite the
    threat from quantum computers, there are ways to mitigate the risks by increasing
    the maturity around cyber risks. By going on that maturity journey, organizations
    are able to systematically identify weaknesses in their landscape.

    themselves to be *crypto-agile*. As quantum computers get closer, we should be
    able to see the evolution of their capabilities. In the meanwhile, if organizations
    can understand their cryptographic strengths and weaknesses better, they should
    be able to address areas of weakness by upgrading to a better cryptographic methodology.

    denial about the threat, and they are putting themselves and their customers in
    a risky situation. Even where organizations have identified and understood the
    threat, their change cycle of 7 to 8 years could be a major hurdle in effecting
    firm-wide transformation to be quantum-proof.

    As always, it is the *so what's* that matter. We may look at all this as a technology
    issue. However, when systems are breached and data is lost, businesses struggle
    to continue servicing their customers. Therefore, it is critical for businesses
    to get to a position where they are operationally resilient. It is the customers
    that matter when all is said and done. Technology is just a means to an end.
