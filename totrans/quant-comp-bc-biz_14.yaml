  zh: 采访 IBM 合伙人 Dinesh Nagarajan
- en: The last century saw two world wars and several other wars of invasion and retaliation.
    Nations waged war upon one another for access to resources that would make them
    more powerful. During World War II, Hitler's invasion of the Caucasus was one
    such instance, with him going after the rich oil resources there. Winston Churchill's
    strategic push in North Africa was to hold key port cities in the region so that
    he could have access to India, which was then a British colony.

  zh: 上个世纪发生了两次世界大战和几场其他的侵略和报复战争。各国相互发动战争，以获取可以使他们更强大的资源。在二战期间，希特勒入侵高加索就是其中一个例子，他追求那里丰富的石油资源。温斯顿·丘吉尔在北非的战略推进是为了控制该地区的关键港口城市，以便他能够进入印度，当时印度还是英国的殖民地。
- en: Access to oil was a fundamental reason for the wars fought in the Middle East
    in the second half of the century. However, geopolitical issues are slowly starting
    to move away from depleting resources such as oil or iron ore, to a resource that
    keeps growing despite consumption – data. By 2025, the world is expected to be
    175 zettabytes rich, of which about 90 ZB will be from the **Internet of Things**
    (**IoT**).

    data, financial data, healthcare data, and the personal data of citizens. Therefore,
    it is important to understand how they intend to leverage technology to gain data
    supremacy. There was a time during the Cold War when there was an arms race between
    the superpowers as to who had more nuclear warheads.

- en: Today, that trend is being seen in the number of patents in technologies such
    as quantum computing, Blockchain, and AI. Therefore, when we discuss these technologies,
    it is important to understand the role they would play in cyber wars that nations
    would want to dominate. Therefore, when I was looking at thought leaders to interview
    for the book, I knew I needed to get an expert in this space. Dinesh Nagarajan,

    的执行合伙人和全球能力领导者 Dinesh Nagarajan 显然就是其中之一。
- en: Dinesh and I worked together at PwC in 2014, where he was focusing on cyber
    security propositions for banks and I was focused on Chief Data Officer advisory
    propositions. He joined IBM in 2016 and has gone from strength to strength. Dinesh
    shares his insights on cyber risks and how technology and the explosion of data
    has made us vulnerable. He stresses that it is not just technology that can help

- en: Dinesh's technology background combined with his involvement with clients who
    are trying to combat cyber risks gives him the ability to understand the impact
    of technology innovation on data security and privacy. He is able to understand
    and stay on top of technology capabilities that exist with different stakeholders
    in the cyber landscape. However, he is also able to apply that understanding to
    the context of cyber wars and cyber risk management. Both Dinesh and I enjoyed

- en: The last two to three decades have brought about some fascinating growth in
    technological advancements across most industries. This is the fifth wave of industrial
    revolution. I think the speed and the pace of change has been phenomenal. Most
    industries in this period have gone through digitization that transformed previously

- en: Therefore, organizations today are interconnecting legacy systems that previously
    have never been exposed outside the data center. These systems can be mobile applications,
    web applications, or social media. There is a fundamental change in the way organizations
    want to service their clients. There is a demand and a change in the way customers
    consume services these days. There is a demand to deliver services quicker. There
    is an "always-on" requirement that customers would like to leverage at any point
    of time, all the time, 24/7\.

- en: Customers also expect instant gratification and instant feedback. This forces
    organizations to be very agile and to be able to respond to these asks. Therefore,
    the most important interface to the client today is digital. Be it financial services,
    logistics, healthcare, or any other critical service we need, we have started
    to rely on and trust digital means more than legacy ways of doing things.

  zh: 客户还期望即时满足和即时反馈。这迫使组织非常灵活，并能够对这些要求做出响应。因此，今天对客户最重要的接口是数字化的。无论是金融服务、物流、医疗保健还是任何其他关键服务，我们开始更多地依赖和信任数字化手段，而不是传统的做事方式。
- en: Most of these interactions are often on the web frontend, mobile apps, or on
    social media. The next wave of interactions will not just be between customers
    and these interfaces, but also between machines. There is a prediction that there
    will be more than 50 billion devices on the IoT in the next 5 years. The other
    interesting prediction on the data side is that even the smallest organization
    will produce 20 times more data in the next 3 years than what they're producing
    today. These numbers are staggering.

- en: In the midst of all this, there is a massive push with regard to moving to the
    cloud. A move to the cloud shouldn't be viewed as just technology transformation.
    There is also business transformation involved. Let's take FinTech for instance.
    FinTech is driving traditional banks to adapt to new business models and ways
    of servicing. As data is being hosted on cloud infrastructure, and shared using
    open banking, we see new business opportunities for third-party solutions that
    can leverage this data. Oftentimes, banks can themselves create these solutions.

  zh: 在所有这些之中，有一个关于转向云端的巨大推动。转向云端不应仅被视为技术转型。还涉及到业务转型。让我们以金融科技为例。金融科技正在推动传统银行适应新的业务模式和服务方式。由于数据托管在云基础架构上，并使用开放银行进行共享，我们看到了可以利用这些数据的第三方解决方案的新商机。通常情况下，银行可以自己创建这些解决方案。
- en: The move to the cloud is also changing the typical traditional IT ecosystem.
    Previously, most critical applications and services were hosted in a secure data
    center. Now they are deployed on a public cloud, interconnected with third-party
    services. Therefore, as these transitions and transformations are in progress,
    the prediction is that cyber-attacks are going to increase in the next 3 years.

    They have automated and orchestrated methods for breaking into a client's infrastructure.
    Once they have broken into the infrastructure, they are able to very quickly get

    attack on a global shipping liner, one of the biggest shipping companies in the

    laptops and disconnect from the network. About 49,000 laptops and 3,500 of the

    IT teams were helpless at the time. It brought the entire firm to a standstill
    for about 9 days, when the recovery of 2,000 laptops got them back into business.
    This is a firm whose ship hits a port in the world every 15 minutes, with most
    ships being able to carry 20,000 containers. If such a large company can be a

- en: Now, that's how cyber criminals can inflict near financial destruction on even
    the biggest of organizations. Therefore, it's no longer a case of just installing
    antivirus software and assuming you are safe from virus attacks; cyber security
    is much bigger than that. Many of the organizations I talk to understand that
    a sophisticated attack could cripple them for days and weeks and plan around that.

  zh: 在过去几年中，有时我感到技术至上几乎是不公平的，因为它可能导致超级大国或组织的出现。特别是当涉及到量子计算时。然而，全世界正在研究量子计算的几个方面。因此，我真诚地希望我们将有几个超级大国，每个都在量子技术的一个方面处于领先地位。
- en: Dominating one aspect of quantum technology such as quantum communication may
    be an enviable position. China has definitely taken the lead when it comes to
    quantum communication. Their quantum satellite experiments have put them ahead
    of the pack. However, there is still much to be achieved in quantum computing.
    There are challenges when quantum particles are used to transmit information or
    model problems. Some of these roadblocks need to be addressed to gain complete
    dominance through quantum technology breakthroughs.

  zh: 在量子技术的某一方面如量子通信上占据优势可能是一个令人羡慕的位置。中国在量子通信方面确实处于领先地位。他们的量子卫星实验使他们走在了前列。然而，在量子计算方面仍有许多待完成的任务。当量子粒子用于传输信息或建模问题时会遇到一些挑战。必须解决其中一些障碍才能通过量子技术突破实现完全的统治。
- en: The conversation with Dinesh has offered several key insights into the field
    of cyber security in a world that is innovating in a massive hurry. Despite the
    threat from quantum computers, there are ways to mitigate the risks by increasing
    the maturity around cyber risks. By going on that maturity journey, organizations
    are able to systematically identify weaknesses in their landscape.

  zh: 与迪尼什的对话为一个在迅速创新的世界里的网络安全领域提供了几个关键见解。尽管量子计算机带来了威胁，但通过增加对网络安全风险的成熟度，有办法减轻风险。通过进行这种成熟度之旅，组织能够系统地识别其景观中的弱点。
- en: Through careful planning with cyber security experts, organizations can prepare
    themselves to be *crypto-agile*. As quantum computers get closer, we should be
    able to see the evolution of their capabilities. In the meanwhile, if organizations
    can understand their cryptographic strengths and weaknesses better, they should
    be able to address areas of weakness by upgrading to a better cryptographic methodology.

  zh: 通过与网络安全专家的仔细规划，组织可以为自己做好*密码敏捷*的准备。随着量子计算机的日益临近，我们应该能够看到其能力的演进。与此同时，如果组织能更好地了解其加密的优势和劣势，他们应该能够通过升级到更好的加密方法来解决弱点。
- en: Dinesh also briefly mentioned that there are organizations that are still in
    denial about the threat, and they are putting themselves and their customers in
    a risky situation. Even where organizations have identified and understood the
    threat, their change cycle of 7 to 8 years could be a major hurdle in effecting
    firm-wide transformation to be quantum-proof.

  zh: 迪尼什还简要提到，仍然有一些组织对威胁持否认态度，他们正在将自己和客户置于危险境地。即使组织已经确定并了解了威胁，他们的7到8年的变革周期可能是影响全面实施量子安全的主要障碍。
- en: Finally, one critical point that Dinesh made was about business resilience.
    As always, it is the *so what's* that matter. We may look at all this as a technology
    issue. However, when systems are breached and data is lost, businesses struggle
    to continue servicing their customers. Therefore, it is critical for businesses
    to get to a position where they are operationally resilient. It is the customers
    that matter when all is said and done. Technology is just a means to an end.

  zh: 最后，Dinesh 提出的一个关键观点是关于企业的韧性。一如既往，重要的是*so what's*。我们可能把所有这些都看作技术问题。然而，当系统遭受攻击并丢失数据时，企业难以继续为客户提供服务。因此，对企业来说，达到一种操作上的韧性非常关键。说到底，重要的是客户。技术只是达到目的的手段。
