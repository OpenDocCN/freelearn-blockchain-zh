    to prevent email spam. The idea is that, in order to send an email, users' computers
    need to do some calculations first. As it takes time, energy, and processing power
    to do such calculations, this adds a cost base to sending an email. Such a cost
    is not expected to be prohibitive for legitimate email users, as the number of
    emails they send is reasonably low, while it should discourage spammers, who send
    thousands of emails daily. For this purpose, hash functions are used, which are
    a special type of mathematical function. A computer would need to calculate a
    hash function multiple times, in order to find the required solution to a computational
    puzzle.

  zh: 1997年，亚当·巴克介绍了他的Hashcash概念。这被设计成一个防止电子邮件垃圾邮件的系统。这个想法是，为了发送电子邮件，用户的计算机首先需要进行一些计算。由于进行这样的计算需要时间、能量和处理能力，因此这为发送电子邮件增加了成本基础。对于合法的电子邮件用户来说，这样的成本预计不会是禁锢的，因为他们发送的电子邮件数量是相对较低的，而它应该会阻止垃圾邮件发送者每天发送数千封电子邮件。为此，使用了哈希函数，它们是一种特殊类型的数学函数。计算机需要多次计算哈希函数，以找到计算难题所需的解决方案。
- en: A concept similar to Hashcash was introduced even earlier, in a 1992 paper by
    Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor, titled *Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk
    Mail*. Their main idea was to require a user to compute a moderately hard function,

- en: In a BitGold network, solved cryptographic puzzles would be sent to the community,
    and, if accepted, the work would be credited to the person who had done it. This
    would then translate into newly generated digital coins. A new puzzle would only
    be released once a solution to the previous one was found and accepted by the
    community. In the process of solving such tasks, community members who come up
    with solutions would own growing amounts of new digital property. This aspect
    of the system provided a way for the network to verify and timestamp new coins.
    Unless a majority of the parties agreed to accept new solutions, they couldn't
    start on the next puzzle. Nick Szabo made a good point about digital value creation,
    given that the computational work required in the process is unforgeable. Until
    a network participant came up with a solution, no extra coins were issued. Therefore,
    this digital money supply was scarce, difficult to produce, and could be securely
    stored and transferred. This is a very close concept to Bitcoin mining.

    Szabo）对数字价值创造提出了很好的观点，鉴于在该过程中所需的计算工作是无法伪造的。除非网络参与者提出解决方案，否则不会发行额外的硬币。因此，这种数字货币供应是稀缺的，难以生产，并且可以安全地存储和转移。这与比特币挖掘非常接近。

    not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central
    authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each
    transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only
    coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem

- en: We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any
    earlier transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that
    counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to
    confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the
    mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived
    first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly
    announced, and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history
    of the order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time
    of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received."
