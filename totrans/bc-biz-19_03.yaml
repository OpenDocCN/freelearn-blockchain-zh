    of the modern fiat currency system, the world entered a new era of mostly freely
    fluctuating foreign exchange rates. National central banks started to implement
    various monetary policies to manage money supply in their respective economies.
    Monetary policy objectives may have had various nuances around the world, but
    a common, widely accepted theme has been inflation targeting. This is done in
    order to provide healthy, stable, low inflation rates, facilitating sustained
    economic growth. By targeting low inflation rates, central banks around the world
    aim to create stable economic conditions, providing the right incentives for consumers'
    and businesses' economic activity, in the absence of huge price swings up or down.

    Again, this is due to the huge amount of liquidity, or new money supply, entering

    stock markets, and venture capital. This, of course, inflated their prices. As
    these asset classes are normally mostly accessible to wealthy investors that use
    the services of savvy asset managers, the net effect was a growing wealth gap.
    On the other hand, the majority of people with little or no investable assets,
    whose income is mostly based on labor wages, haven't nearly experienced the same

    to prevent email spam. The idea is that, in order to send an email, users' computers
    need to do some calculations first. As it takes time, energy, and processing power
    to do such calculations, this adds a cost base to sending an email. Such a cost
    is not expected to be prohibitive for legitimate email users, as the number of
    emails they send is reasonably low, while it should discourage spammers, who send
    thousands of emails daily. For this purpose, hash functions are used, which are
    a special type of mathematical function. A computer would need to calculate a
    hash function multiple times, in order to find the required solution to a computational
    puzzle.

    in order to gain access to a shared resource, thus preventing frivolous use.

    certain amount of work, and thus, the work done arguably has value.

    as a digital coin.”

- en: In a BitGold network, solved cryptographic puzzles would be sent to the community,
    and, if accepted, the work would be credited to the person who had done it. This
    would then translate into newly generated digital coins. A new puzzle would only
    be released once a solution to the previous one was found and accepted by the
    community. In the process of solving such tasks, community members who come up
    with solutions would own growing amounts of new digital property. This aspect
    of the system provided a way for the network to verify and timestamp new coins.
    Unless a majority of the parties agreed to accept new solutions, they couldn't
    start on the next puzzle. Nick Szabo made a good point about digital value creation,
    given that the computational work required in the process is unforgeable. Until
    a network participant came up with a solution, no extra coins were issued. Therefore,
    this digital money supply was scarce, difficult to produce, and could be securely
    stored and transferred. This is a very close concept to Bitcoin mining.

    building upon the Proof-of-Work concept introduced earlier. The purpose of Reusable
    Proof-of-Work was as token money. Just as a gold coin's value is underpinned by
    the value of the raw gold needed to make it, the value of a Reusable Proof-of-Work
    token is guaranteed by the value of the work done in order to generate it. And,
    as we already know, the value of the work is backed by the real-world computer
    resources and electricity required to do it. He referenced Nick Szabo's Bit Gold
    idea of digital goods that are provably costly to create.

    coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem

    mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived
    first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly

    solution is to introduce a trusted central authority to run the ledger of transactions,
    just like a bank. History has shown many times that such central parties, or middlemen,
    can present a risk of their own, and have been compromised far too often.

    system similar to what banks operate. This is related to the activity of taking
    deposits, making loans funded by these deposits, and keeping only a fraction of
    the deposits in reserve. This obviously creates credit risks for deposit holders.
    Since PayPal doesn't do that, it follows lighter regulations as a money transmitter.
    This model is quite centralized, is similar to the banking model, and is subject
    to all of the risks associated with it.

- en: To summarize, designing a centralized payment architecture is much easier than
    designing a decentralized one. However, the centralized model presents security
    threats from hacks, because there is a clear and attractive target for such attacks.
    A centralized system also presents a more expensive and inefficient solution for
    customers, because it tends to create monopolies, or cartels. This concentrates
    market power in the hands of a small group of intermediaries, which can extract
    disproportionately large values, in the form of transaction fees. The customer
    outcomes resulting from the legacy financial infrastructure are expensive, slow
    transactions. This sector has not seen any major innovations in a very long time,
    and it is ripe for disruption.

    more difficult solution of decentralized consensus in transaction processing.
    This design enables it to deliver a much more efficient solution for all parties
    involved. Payments go directly from peer to peer, and security and processing
    are guaranteed by the entire network. Funds are sent and received in a matter
    of minutes. All of the network participants maintain a consensus of the current
    state of the transaction ledger, at all times.
