- en: I did my Bachelor's in Engineering at **Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham** (**AVVP**).
    I graduated in 2003 and moved to Mumbai for my first job as a software consultant.
    If someone asked me if there was a period of my life that I would want to relive,
    it is without a doubt the time I spent at this amazing institution. Over the years
    after I graduated, AVVP has only got better, and I feel jealous of the current
    students!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason why AVVP has become one of the top 10 institutions in India is largely
    due to the quality of the teaching faculty members. When I meet my start-ups at
    Green Shores Capital (my fund), I often tell them that founders need to be storytellers.
    The best storytellers often grow faster than the rest, as they can paint their
    vision so well that people feel inspired and want to be part of the start-up's
    journey. That is true with teachers too. The difference is that teachers are a
    lot more selfless than start-up founders, who often have dreams of making billions.

    B. Rajathilagam (BRT), who blessed us with her lectures for 3 years of our university
    life. When I meet her, I jokingly tell her that I don't remember the **Object-Oriented
    Programming Systems** (**OOPS**) concepts she taught us anymore; but I can never
    forget the lift/elevator example she gave us to bring those concepts to life.

    engineering. I found that we had reached a saturation point in feature engineering
    where we were not able to capture minor details in signals, images, videos, and
    so on. I think there are so many areas that conventional algorithms were not able
    to capture. We had reached a bottleneck where the performance did not meet our
    expectations. Therefore, I was looking at algorithms to overcome these limitations
    during my research. I found that quantum computing principles inherently have
    the nature and the ability to solve these limitations.'

    theory defines the characteristics of atomic particles in quantum mechanics. It
    offers mathematical representations and abstractions that can help you with a
    real-world problem that you are trying to solve. Some of the multi-dimensional
    problems that we are working on can be represented by group theory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I started looking at algorithms using the principles of quantum mechanics. Using
    group theory techniques, we developed feature filters (**G-lets**) for signals,
    and those filters could also work for multi-dimensional signals. There is a natural
    flow in that mathematical abstraction that captures quantum mechanics. Therefore,
    it works more seamlessly on a quantum computer than on a classical computer. We
    then made a quantum algorithm for signal processing in order to capture the features.
    Following that, we also made a classical version of that, although it cannot be
    compared to the quantum version.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The exciting part for me was that, even with a simple version of that algorithm
    adapted for a classical computer, it outperformed many of the existing conventional
    feature algorithms. For example, let's say you are listening to a human continuously
    speaking and then you occasionally hear a bird signal – the signal frequency keeps
    changing. Let's say you must capture the point at which the signal transition
    happens from the human voice to the bird signal. That can be very difficult at
    times using existing classical algorithms.
  prefs: []

- en: In a quantum computer, you should be able to do these operations in parallel.
    That was an important capability of quantum computers that made them very exciting
    for me. That capability then moves us into machine learning. Machine learning
    requires a lot of features and a lot of data for us to understand the underlying
    patterns. Therefore, if you can handle so much data and look at the patterns,
    quantum computers turn out to be a better option. So that is how I started looking
    into quantum machine learning, though I still work on classical machine learning
    as well.

    However, annealing techniques are arriving sooner than we initially anticipated.
    Optimization using annealing has become more successful now, and that will be

    have some cameras. In other parts of the world, along with the road infrastructure,
    they have built a digital infrastructure. That digital infrastructure simply does
    not exist in India. What's stopping us is the cost of creating this infrastructure.
    For example, the cameras we currently have will not be useful at night or in bad
    weather. If you have to set up a radar to overcome the technical limitations,
    the costs of implementing it for 1 kilometer is 30 lakhs Indian Rupees (~ £32,000).

    – sensors, cyber physical systems, IoT devices – where will you put them on the
    road? Again, the range at which they work is a challenge. Actually, there is an

    these current limitations.'

    the state of the entire traffic system at any point of time. If there was a central
    traffic management system that these IoT devices connected to, we could first
    capture traffic data in real time to manage traffic. But also, we can do predictive
    analytics to say that (for instance) 2,000 vehicles go through a junction every
    day at a specific time. We can plan traffic regulations and management resources accordingly.

    have better solutions. But, as we see it today, connecting quickly, transmitting
    data in real time, and acting on it has practical difficulties. It''s not because

    UK, we have a nice government-supported program called Innovate UK. I understand
    they have invested over £400 million in quantum computing R&D work. Also, Canada
    has invested similar amounts, but China is perhaps spending the most in this space.
    They have a few billion dollars'' worth of R&D money allocated to quantum computing
    research.'

    behind? We are already lagging with Blockchain and innovation in that field due
    to the ban on cryptocurrency. How do we play catch-up with such a lack of support
    from the government?

    have been toward research led by the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). Prime
    Minister Narendra Modi has been quite good in general. He has introduced something
    called Institutes of Eminence and that will include other top educational institutions,
    like Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS Pilani) and Manipal University.'

    foreign faculties. From a funding perspective, however, most of the funding is
    allocated to IITs, and the rest of the institutions only get a fraction of the
    allocated budget. With a lack of an ecosystem for quantum computing, I don't think
    we will be able to compete with China. Even countries like the UK may struggle
    to compete with them, as China has allocated 10 times more capital for the R&D
    than the UK, for example.

    quantum computing are like successes countries saw in defense and military technologies
    during the Cold War period. If China gets to quantum supremacy first, I would
    be surprised if they shared the technology with India or the US. They will use
    it to their advantage to stay ahead in information warfare.

    circuitry, we have silicon chips and hydrogen atoms being used to make them. MIT
    recently published an article in *Nature* that hydrogen atoms can be used to make
    qubits at room temperature. I follow this research closely. I have some material

    where I think the semiconductor industry could look up to the material data science industry
    to build better devices. If you think about it, quantum computers have particle
    physics as a fundamental element, and we have so many different types of particles.
    We haven't really tried all of them to form qubit circuits. They all come with
    different characteristics, so depending on the suitability, we may potentially
    have quite a lot of options for qubit construction.

    industry. We may not see a monopoly in quantum computers (hardware) as we have seen

    be successful when we have multi-disciplinary experts coming together. Computer
    scientists, physicists, and material scientists are all needed to create meaningful
    innovation in this space. That is only happening within communities like MIT,
    and we will need that awareness and capability across the industry globally. At
    this point, I see only a very few institutions in India working in this space.
    ISRO is looking into it, but even there only from a satellite communication perspective.

    enlightened me with several industry insights during the interview. The enthusiasm
    she has for technology was very evident, especially if you had the privilege of
    listening to the recording of this interview. In the absence of that, I will quickly
    list the key takeaways from this interview chapter.

    BRT brought to life the opportunities that she has identified while working with
    villages in India. However, if that is executed at a small scale, there is no
    reason why such technologies can't be scaled in other rural parts of the world.

    one she mentioned was implemented using a central digital infrastructure, powered
    by quantum machine learning, the industry could be more efficient and effective.
    She also touched upon several other healthcare use cases like diagnoses using
    machine learning, and how quantum computers can add value there.

    of the points discussed in this interview have been explored in much more detail
    in that chapter. One of the key points that BRT touched upon is the importance
    of an ecosystem, and how a technological advantage could help nations get their
    noses ahead in an information race.
