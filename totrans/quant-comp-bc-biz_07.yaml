    I graduated in 2003 and moved to Mumbai for my first job as a software consultant.
    If someone asked me if there was a period of my life that I would want to relive,
    it is without a doubt the time I spent at this amazing institution. Over the years

- en: The reason why AVVP has become one of the top 10 institutions in India is largely
    due to the quality of the teaching faculty members. When I meet my start-ups at
    Green Shores Capital (my fund), I often tell them that founders need to be storytellers.
    The best storytellers often grow faster than the rest, as they can paint their
    vision so well that people feel inspired and want to be part of the start-up's
    journey. That is true with teachers too. The difference is that teachers are a
    lot more selfless than start-up founders, who often have dreams of making billions.

    engineering. I found that we had reached a saturation point in feature engineering
    where we were not able to capture minor details in signals, images, videos, and
    so on. I think there are so many areas that conventional algorithms were not able
    to capture. We had reached a bottleneck where the performance did not meet our
    expectations. Therefore, I was looking at algorithms to overcome these limitations
    during my research. I found that quantum computing principles inherently have
    the nature and the ability to solve these limitations.'

- en: One of the fundamental concepts for quantum mechanics is group theory. Group
    theory defines the characteristics of atomic particles in quantum mechanics. It
    offers mathematical representations and abstractions that can help you with a

- en: I started looking at algorithms using the principles of quantum mechanics. Using
    group theory techniques, we developed feature filters (**G-lets**) for signals,
    and those filters could also work for multi-dimensional signals. There is a natural
    flow in that mathematical abstraction that captures quantum mechanics. Therefore,
    it works more seamlessly on a quantum computer than on a classical computer. We
    then made a quantum algorithm for signal processing in order to capture the features.
    Following that, we also made a classical version of that, although it cannot be
    compared to the quantum version.

  zh: 我开始研究使用量子力学原理的算法。利用群论技术，我们为信号开发了特征滤波器（**G-lets**），这些滤波器也可以用于多维信号。在数学抽象中有一种自然流动，可以捕捉量子力学。因此，它在量子计算机上的运行比在经典计算机上更无缝。然后，我们制作了一个用于信号处理的量子算法，以捕捉特征。随后，我们还制作了一个经典版本，尽管它无法与量子版本相比。
- en: The exciting part for me was that, even with a simple version of that algorithm
    adapted for a classical computer, it outperformed many of the existing conventional
    feature algorithms. For example, let's say you are listening to a human continuously
    speaking and then you occasionally hear a bird signal – the signal frequency keeps
    changing. Let's say you must capture the point at which the signal transition
    happens from the human voice to the bird signal. That can be very difficult at
    times using existing classical algorithms.

  zh: 对我来说令人兴奋的部分是，即使是为经典计算机量身定制的简化版本算法，也超越了许多现有的传统特征算法。例如，假设你正在持续听一个人讲话，然后偶尔听到鸟的信号——信号频率不断变化。假设你必须捕捉信号从人声转变为鸟声的时刻。使用现有的经典算法有时可能会非常困难。
- en: In a quantum computer, you should be able to do these operations in parallel.
    That was an important capability of quantum computers that made them very exciting
    for me. That capability then moves us into machine learning. Machine learning
    requires a lot of features and a lot of data for us to understand the underlying
    patterns. Therefore, if you can handle so much data and look at the patterns,
    quantum computers turn out to be a better option. So that is how I started looking
    into quantum machine learning, though I still work on classical machine learning
    as well.

    Thank you so much for your time and your insights.'

  zh: 结论
- en: Even after almost 20 years of listening to BRT at university, she inspired and
    enlightened me with several industry insights during the interview. The enthusiasm
    she has for technology was very evident, especially if you had the privilege of
    listening to the recording of this interview. In the absence of that, I will quickly
    list the key takeaways from this interview chapter.

  zh: 即使在大学听了将近20年的BRT后，她在采访中也给我带来了一些行业见解，启发了我。她对技术的热情非常明显，尤其是如果你有幸听到这次采访的录音的话。在没有那个的情况下，我会快速列出这次采访章节的主要收获。
- en: We touched upon how quantum machine learning could change lives in rural areas.
    BRT brought to life the opportunities that she has identified while working with
    villages in India. However, if that is executed at a small scale, there is no
    reason why such technologies can't be scaled in other rural parts of the world.

  zh: 我们谈到了量子机器学习如何改变农村地区的生活。BRT在与印度村庄合作时发现了她所确定的机会。然而，如果以小规模执行，没有理由为什么这些技术不能在世界其他农村地区扩大规模。
- en: I was particularly moved by her healthcare examples. If a solution like the
    one she mentioned was implemented using a central digital infrastructure, powered
    by quantum machine learning, the industry could be more efficient and effective.
    She also touched upon several other healthcare use cases like diagnoses using
    machine learning, and how quantum computers can add value there.

  zh: 她提到的关于医疗保健的例子让我特别感动。如果像她提到的那样使用一个由量子机器学习驱动的中央数字基础设施来实现解决方案，这个行业可以变得更加高效和有效。她还提及了几个其他医疗保健应用案例，比如使用机器学习进行诊断，以及量子计算机如何在这方面增加价值。
- en: I have used this interview as an inspiration for the smart cities chapter. Some
    of the points discussed in this interview have been explored in much more detail
    in that chapter. One of the key points that BRT touched upon is the importance
    of an ecosystem, and how a technological advantage could help nations get their
    noses ahead in an information race.

  zh: 我已经将这次采访作为智能城市章节的灵感来源。在那一章中，讨论的一些观点已经被更详细地探讨了。BRT提到的一个关键点是生态系统的重要性，以及技术优势如何帮助国家在信息竞争中领先。
- en: Finally, her insights about the semiconductor industry and how that could transform with
    quantum computers was interesting. The world could do with more competition in
    this space as different solutions for qubit circuitry emerge.

  zh: 最后，她对半导体行业的见解以及如何利用量子计算机来改变这个行业的想法令人感兴趣。在不同的量子比特电路解决方案出现时，世界可以拥有更多这方面的竞争。
- en: We have two more interview chapters that will touch upon topics such as error
    correction and cybersecurity-related quantum computing applications.
