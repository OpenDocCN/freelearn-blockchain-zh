    is to create what are called "entangled nodes." This is achieved by a process
    whereby entangled protons are exchanged between these nodes. Once these nodes
    are entangled, entire qubits can be transmitted between them, without physically
    sending the qubits across the network.

    communicate across several ground stations. Entangled photon pairs were created
    using crystals and lasers. These entangled photon pairs were split and transmitted
    to different ground stations. Therefore, quantum information could be transmitted
    between these stations, which were located in the cities of Delingha and Lijiang,
    1,203 kilometers away.

    with the superposition of two energy states. The ion also emitted a photon with
    a qubit encoded in its polarization states. As the qubits are entangled, they
    can be transmitted to two quantum stations that are separated by a distance and
    can be used for communication.

    In this process, the two nodes would transmit an entangled photon to a station
    in the middle. The photons will be measured at the station in the middle, which
    will result in them losing entanglement with their ions. However, this process
    caused the two ions to become entangled with one another.
