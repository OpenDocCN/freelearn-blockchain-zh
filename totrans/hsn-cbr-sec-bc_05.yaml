    its process, and chaincode programming. In this chapter, we will be covering the
    fundamental approach to arrange the components of a native blockchain and Hyperledger
    in the form of the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** (**CIA**)
    security triad model. This triad model is one of the oldest and most popular security
    frameworks connected with the blockchain structure. The CIA triad model is a model
    that helps organizations structure their security posture. We will understand
    how these three core elements impact the blockchain technology and how we can
    organize the optimal use of blockchain with this security model.

    and systems used by the **information security** (**infosec**) team. It is also
    sometimes referred to as the **Availability, Integrity, and Confidentiality**
    (**AIC**) security triad. The purpose of the triad is to deliver a standard framework
    to evaluate and deploy information security policies, independent of the underlying
    technology, network, or system.

    When information that has to be secret remains a secret, you achieve confidentiality.
    In this current time of digital connectivity, everyone is aggressive enough to
    know that information that has been kept a secret. Security agencies are a prime
    example of a company breaking confidentiality so that they can perform forensics
    and use surveillance footage. Financially motivated cyber criminals do their best
    to break into security systems and gather confidential documents that will benefit
    their business adversaries.

    is a mandatory compliance for every infosec body. It is also a method to maintain the
    consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of the respective data over its entire
    life cycle. There has to be complete security of the data, and any unauthorized
    access to it should be prohibited. Certain measures that aid these aforementioned
    things include file permission and user access controls.

    from data to information and information to value means that the value will be
    illegitimate if the information is not available at the right time. **Distributed
    denial-of-service** (**DDoS**) and ransomware attacks are some of the most powerful
    weapons in the hands of malicious actors, and they use these attacks to keep information
    away from people who have authorized and legitimate access. Organizations make
    several attempts to combat these attacks, including web application firewalls,
    DDoS protection, **content delivery network **(**CDN**), and even disaster recovery.

    and these challenges can be about privacy exposure, confidentiality breaches,
    identity theft, and many more. Blockchain technology is a computing technology
    that runs over a digital ecosystem and hence it becomes important to pay attention
    to its fundamental security challenges. Every size of business connected globally
    allocates an annual budget for cyber security so that they can keep their information
    and critical assets confidential. Let's understand the extent of confidentiality
    in the current blockchain model and its future roadmap.

    it was never made to be restrictive in nature, as anyone with client software
    can participate in the block generation process, or mining, in the case of Bitcoin.
    Confidentiality with respect to the blockchain is simply about hiding transaction
    information from unwanted participants in the network. However, because of the
    open and permissionless nature of the public blockchain such as Bitcoin, achieving
    a better confidentiality rank can be extremely difficult.

    still reluctant to use public cloud solutions. It is a common practice to apply
    encryption to the data going to the cloud, but encryption can only provide solid
    confidentiality against internal attacks; it can't protect data from corruption
    caused by configuration errors, software bugs, or espionage attempts. Although
    blockchain technology has its own solid approach in achieving immutability with
    the hashing algorithm and the Merkle tree model for integrity, we have to try
    and understand how it would practically work with real-world applications and
    Hyperledger Fabric.

    hashing to ensure that the ledger remains tamper-proof. One of the key characteristics
    of this hashing function is that it is always one-way, which means it is logically
    impossible to get the data back from the hash result or from the message digest.
    It is also difficult to analyze the pattern of message digest and predict the

    and the creation of a new block depends on the hash of the previous block. This
    stops the possibility of malicious attempts to disturb, alter, or delete any blocks
    in the ledger. This helps organizations achieve a new level of cyber security
    integrity and provides a platform on which you can develop a tamper-proof business

    there are several key properties that keep it apart from the others. Committing
    a peer always validates the new block before adding it to the ledger. A situation
    where a peer is hacked means that the block may get compromised from the ledger.
    To avoid such a situation, there are certain methods to correct the way a block
    gets added in the ledger.

- en: Business applications are accessible through networks (public or private), and
    these applications are sets of code that have value until it is accessible, which
    is when it is needed. Blockchain is a software application running on the cloud
    and keeps its value until it is not broken or disturbed. For users, the face of
    blockchain is simply a **decentralized application** (**dApp**), and in order
    keep it available all of the time, both the front end and the backend of the system
    should run seamlessly.

    technology. Although the Bitcoin blockchain is strong enough to justify the CIA
    security framework, as a blockchain, it is appreciated and adopted by several
    organizations, and several flavors of blockchain are coming to the market to fulfil
    specific business models. We have seen how Hyperledger Fabric fits into the CIA
    security triad and what makes the Hyperledger Fabric system a business-friendly
