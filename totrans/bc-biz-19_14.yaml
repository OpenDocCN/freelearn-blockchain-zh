    with the use of cryptography. It can be used to optimize the efficiency of value
    transfer networks, asset registers, and marketplaces. That's why it's also called
    distributed ledger technology. A distributed ledger ensures that all parties in
    a network are on the same page at all times with regards to their past activities
    and current balances, as they update each new piece of information simultaneously.
    This is mostly a process innovation, which is very useful in the digital age when
    most transactions and business processes are managed electronically. Its applications,
    as we have seen throughout this book, range from financial services to supply-chain
    management and smart contracts.

- en: AI, although a very common buzz word currently, is not a brand new concept.
    Research in the field started in the 1950s with computers learning simple games
    such as checkers. In the beginning, expectations were that within 20 years, machines
    will be capable of doing any work a human can do. Subsequently, progress in AI
    had its ups and downs, due to limitations in computing power and commercial viability,
    which impacted the available funding and public focus on the field. This should
    hardly be a surprise as it's a commonly repeating pattern in technological progress.
    A parallel can be drawn to space exploration with all the moon missions in the
    1960s and 1970s, which have subsequently been discontinued or substantially slowed
    down. The public spotlight and funding budgets are a key driver behind continued
    innovation.

    success in the 1990s and 2000s. It found use cases in logistics, data mining,
    medical diagnoses, and other areas. Another major breakthrough happened when the
    computer Deep Blue, developed by IBM, became the first AI to beat a world chess
    champion when it played with Garry Kasparov in 1997.

    everywhere around us, as more sectors are increasingly driven to automate tasks
    with smart algorithms. Some examples include Amazon's personalized user recommendations
    based on previous purchases or activity; Facebook and Google's targeted ads, Uber's
    AI model to determine arrival times, pick-up locations, and fare prices, and PayPal's
    machine learning algorithms to detect and combat fraud. According to the technology-research
    firm Tractica, which has identified over 150 specific AI use cases across 29 industries,
    the global market for AI software and services will reach $60,000,000,000 by 2025.

    to be the intersection between blockchain and AI. Data is a key resource that
    enables AI development. Blockchain, fundamentally, is a data structure that enables
    efficient ways of crowdsourcing resources through peer-to-peer marketplaces and
    incentive mechanisms that originate from game theory. Therefore, the first projects
    we saw that tried to combine both technologies revolved around AI marketplaces
    and crowdsourced computing resources. Given AI's enormous potential and the current
    state of the global tech industry, where market power is highly concentrated in
    a handful of very powerful companies, it may be a good thing to have a decentralized
    alternative for AI resources.

    blockchain. They basically use blockchain technology to create decentralized marketplaces
    for AI algorithms, datasets, and shared computational resources to train such
    algorithms. The added advantage of blockchain is data encryption, which helps
    protect privacy in a sharing economy. Homomorphic encryption can be used to protect
    both user data and AI models from being compromised in a cloud-computing environment.
    This refers to an encryption method that makes the result of an operation on plaintext
    equivalent to the result of an operation on ciphertext.

- en: Given the inherent data and computational redundancy in blockchains, deploying
    AI smart contracts at scale still presents many challenges and may always be inferior
    in performance to centralized engines. Still, some machine learning algorithms
    could be deployable on-chain in a cost and data-efficient manner to bring smart
    contracts to the next level. For the moment, the most feasible combination of
    blockchain and AI technologies seems to be for pooling computational resources
    together and distributing them across a network of algorithmic and data providers
    to harness these resources in a collaborative manner in order to emulate the performance
    and output of large, world-class AI companies.
