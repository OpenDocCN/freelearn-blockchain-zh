    meeting the needs of the populace. It is the mechanism of running a government
    using a set of principles defined in a constitution. Politics involves the art
    of governance, but is often considered to go beyond governance; it is also the
    means by which an individual or an organization establishes and enforces governance.

    Governments of developing countries focus on judicial effectiveness, poverty eradication,

    is largely common across governments; they have been slow in going digital and
    embracing innovation when compared to their private sector counterparts. There are very
    few incentives to do so. With businesses in Financial Services or healthcare,
    there are competitive reasons to adopt innovation. Without a technology edge,
    they would often quickly become irrelevant. However, due to the lack of competition,
    governments have no such pressure.
