    authority by building a trustless network that decentralizes all the tasks that
    are otherwise centralized in a single entity. P2P networking is an architecture
    style used to achieve this decentralization in blockchain applications. We'll

    computers called nodes are interconnected, sharing data without the assistance
    of any centralized servers. It is an architecture on top of the internet. Participants
    or nodes in this type of network are called peers because they are all equal and
    have equal responsibility within the network. Since there are no special nodes
    in a P2P network, each peer is both a service provider and a consumer.

    filesharing was popularized by the music-sharing application Napster. However,
    a number of music services followed that had a similar P2P filesharing model.
    Although Napster was the pioneer, filesharing in P2P has gained a lot of attention
    due to the BitTorrent protocol, which allows the filesharing of any digital media.

- en: P2P networking is an architecture where each peer acts as a server and a client
    simultaneously. Since a blockchain network is often implemented on a public network,
    it is difficult to create a physical topology that is suitable for P2P networking.
    To create this kind of architecture, a virtual or logical network overlay has
    to be constructed over the actual physical network topology. A logical network
    is created to achieve a convenient index of resources and peer discovery in a
    public network. Although an overlay is formed, data will be exchanged over the
    TCP/IP network.

    be able to communicate directly if the topology is a full mesh, where each node
    is linked to all the peers in the network. A partial mesh configuration is always
    preferable because constructing a full-mesh topology is expensive.

- en: In an unstructured network, the peers aren't linked to each other in an organized
    way. Each node is randomly connected to the peers, forming a logical mesh. It
    is easy to build unstructured networks, and they are very robust due to the redundant
    distribution of nodes. However, these networks have drawbacks, such as the possibility
    of request flooding, an effect caused by a lack of knowledge about the distribution
    of resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A structured P2P network overlay is formed by following a specific network topology
    to make sure that nodes can efficiently perform activities on the network. Creating
    a structured network ensures that a resource can be fetched from somewhere on
    the network in a certain time. A **distributed hash table** (**DHT**) is a widely
    used structured network implementation that provides decentralized lookup service.
    Resource information in a DHT can be retrieved from hash tables using the key
    of a key/value pair stored in the table. The value associated with the key provides
    information about the peer that owns the resource. DHTs are also used in the BitTorrent
    filesharing protocol as a substitute for centralized lookup services, such as
    trackers.

- en: Network discovery in a P2P network is crucial. No network is defined when a
    new node boots up. The new node must detect at least one blockchain node to be
    a part of the network. There are several ways in which a node can identify peers
    and thus discover a network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and efficient routing. We're going to start by exploring basic P2P network discovery
    by taking a look at Bitcoin's original implementation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The simplest way to find the list of peers to connect to is by hardcoding a
    few of the well-known peers. Using a central server that maintains a list of peers
    is another approach. Bitcoin holds information about DNS seeds, which provide
    a high level of reliability when a node is initially set up, and will respond
    with a list of the IP addresses of the Bitcoin nodes. Once a seed node is detected,
    the node will establish a TCP connection to perform a handshake with that node.
    The handshake validates the node by sending the version, the address, local blockchain
    information, and any other relevant information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once a connection is set up between peers that have been discovered by the node,
    the node can query for information about other nodes that are connected to its
    peer. Similarly, the node can broadcast its own address information to the connected
    peers to improve its reachability. Each node also makes sure to maintain a threshold
    for the number of active connections in order to avoid unnecessary bandwidth usage.

    protocol suite called RLPx, which provides a general-purpose transport and interface
    for applications to communicate via a P2P network. RLPx utilizes a Kademlia-like
    routing to ensure uniform network formation. After the initial node handshake,
    packets are encapsulated as frames, which are then encrypted.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each node that joins the blockchain network needs to update its local copy of
    the blockchain to synchronize its state with the global state of the rest of the
    network. This is achieved by block synchronization. A node that needs to update
    its blockchain sends a message consisting of blockchain height information. Any
    peer that has a longer blockchain sends an inventory consisting of metadata about
    the fixed number of blocks that needs to be added to the host node. Now the node
    makes a request to all its peers to fetch individual blocks by referring to the
    inventory it received. The node should make sure not to flood the network with
    block requests by maintaining a cap on the number of block requests it sends.

    all the blocks are up to date, it can verify the information in the block, such
    as the transactions on assets. The block synchronization process can be reinitialized
    whenever the node comes online after being inactive.

    ensure that the Byzantine failure problem can be solved, a global truth can be
    maintained in a decentralized network in which there is no trust between the peers.

    a block validation to ensure that the block can be appended to the local copy
    of the blockchain. Block validation is a simple process of checking whether the
    latest block has a pointer or hash reference pointing to the previous block. When
    a block includes complex data, such as a set of transactions, independent transactions
    have to be verified to validate the block. Since we will not be dealing with any
    complex data inside the block, verifying transactions is beyond the scope of this

    when two or more nodes create a block at the same time that has different identities
    due to the different content included in its block. When a node receives different
    versions of a block of the same height, it will add one of them to the blockchain
    based on the order of arrival and either rejects the other or keeps it in a memory
    pool. Due to this, nodes in the network might end up with different versions of
    the blockchain. This is called a temporary fork or a soft fork.
