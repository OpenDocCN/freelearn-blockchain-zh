    available today for developing a blockchain-based application or launching a blockchain-based
    project. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are not unique. Some infrastructures
    have appeared in the past few years, enabling fresh functionalities, such as setting
    conditions, defining a certain level of privacy within the network, or certifying
    nodes. In this chapter, we will explore some of these enterprise-grade solutions,
    namely Quorum, Hyperledger, Aergo, and Corda, and explore cloud-based solutions
    such as the IBM Blockchain Platform and Oracle Blockchain Platform, which we already
    mentioned in previous chapters. Here, we will also explore other **Blockchain-as-a-Service**
    (**BaaS**) providers such as **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**) and Microsoft Azure
    and explore in slightly greater depth what services they offer and how effective
    they are.

    on the market. The Bitcoin blockchain is considered the first generation, a very
    secure and decentralized infrastructure, which is why more and more miners are
    joining the network, but with low performance in terms of processing transactions
    and weak upgradability; in other words, users cannot do much more with Bitcoin''s
    blockchain than send Bitcoin. Ethereum is considered the second generation of
    blockchain because it implemented major improvements to the initial protocol such
    as smart contracts. The third and fourth generations of blockchain are mostly
    focused on increasing the number of transactions per second, as well as providing
    enterprises with a flexible and suitable infrastructure for their needs. Aergo,
    Quorum, and Hyperledger can be cited as examples of these new blockchains; they
    set out to help the technology evolve dramatically by enhancing reliability and
    overcoming technical difficulties while increasing scalability. The following
    diagram shows the various generations of blockchain:'

    public, private, or semi-private. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both public blockchains
    (also called permissionless blockchains), meaning that there is no restriction
    on who can become a node, who can use the service, and who can validate the transactions.
    They both benefit from a high degree of decentralization and do not require a
    supervisory body as the infrastructure, and their governance are self-organized.
    On the other hand, private and semi-private blockchains (also called permissioned
    blockchains) have a smaller degree of decentralization because only authenticated
    stakeholders can join the infrastructure. Therefore, they have a reduced number
    of nodes and miners compared to public blockchains. Their governance can be partially
    decentralized (we call such an organization a consortium) or totally centralized.
    In that case, roles are predefined for each member and transactions are validated
    and recorded on a private registry that only identified parties can read. To some
    extent, the term private blockchain (or permissioned blockchain) is a malapropism
    for designating a distributed ledger technology.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'As a decision maker, you must remain careful with the terminology employed
    for private blockchains and the way they are implemented. Once again, keep in
    mind that a blockchain is an IT infrastructure that allows digital values to flow
    securely and transparently in a decentralized ecosystem without the need for a
    trusted third party. As soon as there is trust in an ecosystem, you can assume
    that blockchain is not relevant. Some so-called private blockchains only assemble
    actors that already trust each other: what is the point of having a protocol for
    recording transactions in a consensual manner when you know that there are no
    interest in skewing the data? A distributed ledger would suffice.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, why bother implementing private blockchains? Well, they seem to provide
    better answers for enterprise-level issues, compared to public blockchains, that
    are condition-free, transparent, and pseudonymous. And actually, some projects
    have shown real applications. In fact, permissioned blockchains can be very useful
    for a group of stakeholders to handle a business process in common. They know
    each other but they don't trust one another.

- en: To achieve high performance, scalability, and security in a private or semi-private
    network, some features had to be adapted within the infrastructure. Consensus
    protocols used in closed organizations differ from those used by Bitcoin or Ethereum
    (proof-of-work) because the nodes validating the transactions do not need to compete
    based on computational power. Instead, they compete based on their reputation
    within the network (proof-of-authority) or based on a voting system (delegated
    proof-of-stake). In any case, whatever consensus protocol is chosen for a blockchain,
    it should be Byzantine Fault-Tolerant, meaning that it should enable a distributed
    system to reach consensus (that is, an agreement on the same value) even when
    some nodes of the network are faulty. In other words, it should be able to overcome
    the problem illustrated by Byzantine General Problems (see [Chapter 2](9db0c332-bdd9-4457-a708-9d8ca990e507.xhtml),
    *A Technical Dive into Blockchain*). Proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, proof-of-authority,
    and delegated proof-of-stake are all Byzantine Fault-Tolerant protocols used according
    to the extent of decentralization needed, the permissions that need to be granted
    to some nodes to perform actions on the network, data velocity, and scalability.
    Most permissioned blockchains rely on voting and lottery-based consensus such
    as proof-of-stake and delegated proof-of-stake.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This latter is an alternative version of the proof-of-stake protocol, which,
    as a reminder, elects a miner based on the number of tokens (or stake) they possess.
    Delegated proof-of-stake is often compared to a technological democracy because
    it combines real-time voting and reputation to achieve consensus. Every token-holder
    can vote to elect a validator that eventually earns enough votes to become a delegate.
    After becoming a delegate, the node can then validate the transactions and collect
    the rewards for doing so. If they misbehave, voters can withdraw their votes to
    *fire* the bad actor from validating and securing the network. Also, the voting
    power of a token holder (known as the voting weight) is determined by how many
    tokens the account is holding. This protocol benefits from a high degree of decentralization
    and enables a fast process for validating the transactions. On the other hand,
    the bigger the network, the slower it becomes as the voting process increases
    latency. Delegated proof-of-stake hence includes a trade-off between decentralization
    and scalability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regarding scalability, proof-of-authority is a better alternative. It is an
    efficient protocol for permissioned blockchains that was proposed in 2017 by the
    co-founder of Ethereum, Gavin Wood. This protocol arbitrarily identifies nodes
    that will validate transactions. These nodes are chosen based on their reputation
    to become trustworthy entities that will have the responsibility for validating
    and securing transactions. To become a node within a blockchain relying on proof-of
    -authority, a user has to undergo a tough identification process, linking their
    digital identity to their real one and disclosing personal information that prevents
    wrongdoings. The fact that proof-of-authority includes only a restricted number
    of nodes allows the infrastructure to validate more transactions (that is, increase
    the block size) and lower the transaction fees to zero. Because the nodes are
    identified, they are incentivized based on their reputation and not on an underlying
    token, which explains why most blockchains based on proof-of-authority do not
    have a cryptocurrency. This kind of consensus is favored mostly in private blockchains
    such as Quorum, which was developed by J.P. Morgan, who took inspiration from
    proof-of-authority for its consensus algorithm.

    capitalization, and is basically a private version of Ethereum, open source and
    supported by Ethereum's community. Quorum uses a management of confidentiality
    that Ethereum does not offer, enabling participants to decide whether their transactions
    should remain private or be displayed publicly. Quorum also integrates enhanced
    transactions and contract privacy, as well as better performance in general. Quorum
    has great potential to be massively adopted by banking actors and financial institutions
    to the point that J.P. Morgan is willing to manage this activity separately from
    its banking activity. J.P. Morgan is also the first bank to deploy its own cryptocurrency,
    JPMCoin, a Quorum-based currency indexed on the US dollar that digitally represents
    money transfers between institutional actors, investors, and banks.

    platform aims to build a digital ecosystem to facilitate and enhance the oil business
    worldwide. Vakt takes the form of a consortium that has created a transaction
    platform as a single source of truth for the trade life cycle. Based on Quorum,

    and retaining control of participants' identities (that is, preventing malicious
    parties from joining the network). Quorum's purpose is very specific but it is

    and store transactions. Corda chose to focus on privacy and security by properly
    identifying the nodes through a strong KYC to prevent misbehavior and establish
    the beginning of trust in the network. This explains why Corda is often considered
    more of a distributed ledger rather than a blockchain per se. Even though blockchains

    accepting Bitcoin as a payment option to purchase digital content such as apps
    or games from their Windows Phone and Xbox. They actually published research papers
    in 2012 about Bitcoin's protocol weaknesses and offered a BaaS solution in 2016
    after partnering with ConsenSys, a startup founded by Joseph Lubin, a major supporter
    of Ethereum. Lately, in May 2019, Microsoft announced the commercialization of
    Azure Blockchain Service, a product allowing the creation, management, and governance
    of consortium blockchain networks. Azure Blockchain Service is a fully managed
    service for companies that want to build and maintain their own distributed ledgers
    and build applications on it, enabling the definition of permissions, monitoring
    of activities, and control of participants. This service was launched while a
    partnership was announced simultaneously with J.P. Morgan to make available its
    blockchain, Quorum, on Microsoft's platform, hence making it the first usable ledger
    in Azure Blockchain Service.

    general availability of Amazon Managed Blockchain, a service somewhat similar
    to Microsoft's, enabling the creation and management of scalable blockchains based
    on open source frameworks such as Hyperledger or, in the future, Ethereum. AWS
    is the latest cloud service provider to launch a blockchain-related offer, a startling
    fact regarding Amazon's ability to open up markets for its competitors and benefit
    from the usual first-mover advantage upon emerging technologies such as IoT or
    machine learning. This delay was explained by Andy Jassy, AWS's CEO, who deplored,
    at the end of 2017, the lack of blockchain use cases in production, before turning
    things around a few months later in April 2018 by launching AWS Blockchain Templates,
    its first blockchain product, enabling quick private or public network setup.
    In any case, AWS has caught up with Microsoft in providing an effective solution
    and today has a decent position in the market, mainly because they were able to
    benefit from their large user base.

    scratch by inviting members to become nodes and run applications deployed onto
    the platform. AWS facilitates the establishment of a consortium between companies
    to transact in a trustless environment and takes charge of the whole maintenance
    of the network. As a first success, AWS signed a partnership in May 2018 with
    Kaleido, a platform developed by ConsenSys designed to simplify the erection of
    a blockchain, to quick-test different use case scenarios.

    running a blockchain on a given infrastructure because they take responsibility
    for integrating ongoing evolutions and upgrades. In other words, upgradability
    and maintenance remain under the supervision of the cloud services provider, leaving
    you with more room to focus on the go-to-market strategy.

    much of the code, it was expected that their solution called IBM Blockchain unveiled
    in March 2017 would make use of this specific module. This cloud-based solution
    enables developers to build robust and effective networks with improved security
    features including protection from insider attacks and an additional layer cloistering
    the registry off the cloud. Other components such as a digital identity management
    tool, a governance tool, and a shut-down option when a piracy attack is identified,
    are provided with the fully-integrated service. IBM's long-term IT expertise has
    been leveraged to offer a strong and hack-resistant cloud-based alternative empowered
    by a large group of developers, intending to offer their clients an easy-to-deploy
    solution that can support any kind of application. Maersk, Everledger, and Walmart,
    whose blockchain use cases were discussed in [Chapter 7](160a83bc-670e-4c15-9ce8-2c0d0b374684.xhtml),
    *Blockchain for the Business World and Achievements*, are all leading organizations
    that have been making use of IBM Blockchain since its early days in 2017\. As
    blockchain is a strategic imperative according to IBM's CEO, Ginni Rometty, IBM
    took a leap in June 2019 by upgrading its Blockchain platform to enable multi-cloud
    deployments across hybrid clouds such as AWS and Azure, in order to bring the
    next level of interoperability and, of course, decentralization.

    of goods whereas blockchain could provide applications to provide automation and
    increase security and facilitate information exchange. In these circumstances,
    Oracle announced, in July 2018, the launch of its own blockchain platform to catch
    up with IBM''s progress. This platform, designed as a service on Oracle Cloud,

    choice of the infrastructure has to be carefully examined. Of course, you can
    develop your own blockchain from scratch, but that would take much more time and
    many more resources than using an already existing infrastructure. Ethereum, Bitcoin,
    and other public blockchains are sometimes successful enough depending on your
    needs. But to unlock certain industrial issues encountered in the business world,
    you might consider using another solution.

- en: 'Between Corda, Quorum, Hyperledger, and Aergo, the choice is quite hard. They
    are all enterprise-ready and open source, supported by growing communities of
    developers and organizations. Each solution was created to build on-purpose permissioned
    blockchains as an alternative to slow and hard-to-scale public infrastructures.
    The few differences we can identify between them revolve around their primary
    target and vision. While Hyperledger integrates modular frameworks such as Fabric
    or Sawtooth to suit the needs of several industries from healthcare to energy,
    Quorum and Corda are mainly finance-oriented. The large span of modules proposed
    by Hyperledger can get pretty confusing for a newcomer but have the benefit of
    meeting any kind of need for any kind of industry. Quorum and Corda, on the other
    hand, focus mainly on privacy and security issues as well as scalability and overall
    performance to enable a large number of transactions and quasi-instantaneous block
    creation. User-friendliness comes into the equation as an important criterion
    for mass adoption in the business world: Aergo, Corda, and Quorum are more accessible
    solutions than Hyperledger, whose plethora of resources, activities, training
    courses, events, and projects can become quite overwhelming for a decision maker
    keen to launch a blockchain project. The following is a short summary and comparison
    between the infrastructures presented in this chapter:'

    from a template and set up the configuration of the network. Even though your
    company benefits from a large skilled team of developers, they might not be confident
    enough to embrace the ownership and maintenance of blockchain infrastructure.
    Moreover, as many companies already use cloud-based services for other needs,
    it might seem more suitable to extend the agreement to BaaS and benefit from outsourcing
    maintenance and backend development. Another advantage in using BaaS solutions
    is that the technology evolves very rapidly and it can become cumbersome to handle
    the integration of upgrades and patches, as well as resolve scalability issues
    that can be left upto the service provider. Because these solutions are *as a
    service*, the provider takes over maintaining the servers and monitoring and managing
    the network. However, as a decision maker, you must challenge every solution you
    choose and focus on how decentralized it actually is. Indeed, if you determined
    that a blockchain was the most suitable tool to answer your needs, it implies
    that the state of the digital value must be ascertained without a central entity,
    in a decentralized manner. Choosing a BaaS might sometimes go against the inner
    purpose of a blockchain, which is enabling decentralization, because the nodes
    are usually hosted on the same provider''s servers:'
