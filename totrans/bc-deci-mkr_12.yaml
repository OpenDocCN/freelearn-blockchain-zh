    available today for developing a blockchain-based application or launching a blockchain-based
    project. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are not unique. Some infrastructures
    have appeared in the past few years, enabling fresh functionalities, such as setting
    conditions, defining a certain level of privacy within the network, or certifying
    nodes. In this chapter, we will explore some of these enterprise-grade solutions,
    namely Quorum, Hyperledger, Aergo, and Corda, and explore cloud-based solutions
    such as the IBM Blockchain Platform and Oracle Blockchain Platform, which we already
    mentioned in previous chapters. Here, we will also explore other **Blockchain-as-a-Service**
    (**BaaS**) providers such as **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**) and Microsoft Azure
    and explore in slightly greater depth what services they offer and how effective
    they are.

    on the market. The Bitcoin blockchain is considered the first generation, a very
    secure and decentralized infrastructure, which is why more and more miners are
    joining the network, but with low performance in terms of processing transactions
    and weak upgradability; in other words, users cannot do much more with Bitcoin''s
    blockchain than send Bitcoin. Ethereum is considered the second generation of
    blockchain because it implemented major improvements to the initial protocol such
    as smart contracts. The third and fourth generations of blockchain are mostly
    focused on increasing the number of transactions per second, as well as providing
    enterprises with a flexible and suitable infrastructure for their needs. Aergo,
    Quorum, and Hyperledger can be cited as examples of these new blockchains; they
    set out to help the technology evolve dramatically by enhancing reliability and
    overcoming technical difficulties while increasing scalability. The following

  zh: 首先，重要的是要强调市场上有几代区块链。比特币区块链被认为是第一代，它是一个非常安全和去中心化的基础设施，这就是为什么越来越多的矿工加入网络，但在处理交易方面性能较低，可升级性较弱；换句话说，用户在比特币的区块链上除了发送比特币之外，不能做更多的事情。以太坊被认为是第二代区块链，因为它实施了对初始协议的重大改进，例如智能合约。第三和第四代区块链主要集中在提高每秒交易数量，以及为企业提供灵活且适用于其需求的基础设施。Aergo、Quorum和Hyperledger可以被引用为这些新区块链的例子；它们旨在通过增强可靠性、克服技术困难以及提高可伸缩性来大幅促进技术的发展。以下图表展示了各个区块链的不同代：

- en: 'Secondly, you must be aware that blockchains can take three different forms:
    public, private, or semi-private. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both public blockchains
    (also called permissionless blockchains), meaning that there is no restriction
    on who can become a node, who can use the service, and who can validate the transactions.
    They both benefit from a high degree of decentralization and do not require a
    supervisory body as the infrastructure, and their governance are self-organized.
    On the other hand, private and semi-private blockchains (also called permissioned
    blockchains) have a smaller degree of decentralization because only authenticated
    stakeholders can join the infrastructure. Therefore, they have a reduced number
    of nodes and miners compared to public blockchains. Their governance can be partially
    decentralized (we call such an organization a consortium) or totally centralized.
    In that case, roles are predefined for each member and transactions are validated
    and recorded on a private registry that only identified parties can read. To some
    extent, the term private blockchain (or permissioned blockchain) is a malapropism
    for designating a distributed ledger technology.'

  zh: 其次，你必须知道，区块链可以有三种不同形式：公共、私有或半公开。比特币和以太坊都是公共区块链（也称为无权限区块链），这意味着任何人都可以成为节点、使用服务和验证交易而无需限制。它们都受益于高度的去中心化，并且不需要监管机构作为基础设施，它们的治理是自组织的。另一方面，私有和半私有区块链（也称为有权限区块链）由于只有经过身份验证的利益相关者可以加入基础设施，因此去中心化程度较小。因此，它们节点和矿工的数量比公共区块链要少。它们的治理可以部分去中心化（我们称这样的组织为联盟），或者完全集中化。在这种情况下，角色对每个成员是预先定义的，交易是在只有确定方可以阅读的私有注册表上验证和记录的。在某种程度上，私有区块链（或有权限区块链）这个词是指代分布式分类技术的一个错误用法。
- en: 'As a decision maker, you must remain careful with the terminology employed
    for private blockchains and the way they are implemented. Once again, keep in
    mind that a blockchain is an IT infrastructure that allows digital values to flow
    securely and transparently in a decentralized ecosystem without the need for a
    trusted third party. As soon as there is trust in an ecosystem, you can assume
    that blockchain is not relevant. Some so-called private blockchains only assemble
    actors that already trust each other: what is the point of having a protocol for
    recording transactions in a consensual manner when you know that there are no
    interest in skewing the data? A distributed ledger would suffice.'
  id: totrans-19

  zh: 作为决策者，你必须谨慎使用私有区块链的术语以及它们的实施方式。再次提醒，区块链是一种允许数字价值在去中心化生态系统中安全透明地流动的IT基础设施，而无需信任第三方。一旦生态系统中存在信任，你就可以假设区块链不再相关。一些所谓的私有区块链只是将已经互相信任的参与者聚集在一起：当你知道没有利益扭曲数据时，在共识方式记录交易的协议有何意义呢？分布式分类帐就足够了。
- en: So, why bother implementing private blockchains? Well, they seem to provide
    better answers for enterprise-level issues, compared to public blockchains, that
    are condition-free, transparent, and pseudonymous. And actually, some projects
    have shown real applications. In fact, permissioned blockchains can be very useful
    for a group of stakeholders to handle a business process in common. They know
    each other but they don't trust one another.

  zh: 那么，为什么要费心实施私有区块链？嗯，与无条件、透明和匿名的公共区块链相比，它们似乎为企业级问题提供了更好的答案。实际上，一些项目已经显示了真正的应用。事实上，有权限区块链可以非常有用，用于一组利益相关者共同处理业务流程。他们彼此认识，但彼此不信任。
- en: To achieve high performance, scalability, and security in a private or semi-private
    network, some features had to be adapted within the infrastructure. Consensus
    protocols used in closed organizations differ from those used by Bitcoin or Ethereum
    (proof-of-work) because the nodes validating the transactions do not need to compete
    based on computational power. Instead, they compete based on their reputation
    within the network (proof-of-authority) or based on a voting system (delegated
    proof-of-stake). In any case, whatever consensus protocol is chosen for a blockchain,
    it should be Byzantine Fault-Tolerant, meaning that it should enable a distributed
    system to reach consensus (that is, an agreement on the same value) even when
    some nodes of the network are faulty. In other words, it should be able to overcome
    the problem illustrated by Byzantine General Problems (see [Chapter 2](9db0c332-bdd9-4457-a708-9d8ca990e507.xhtml),
    *A Technical Dive into Blockchain*). Proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, proof-of-authority,
    and delegated proof-of-stake are all Byzantine Fault-Tolerant protocols used according
    to the extent of decentralization needed, the permissions that need to be granted
    to some nodes to perform actions on the network, data velocity, and scalability.
    Most permissioned blockchains rely on voting and lottery-based consensus such
    as proof-of-stake and delegated proof-of-stake.

  zh: 要在私有或半私有网络中实现高性能、可扩展性和安全性，必须在基础设施中进行一些调整。 在封闭组织中使用的共识协议与比特币或以太坊（工作证明）中使用的协议不同，因为验证交易的节点不需要基于计算能力进行竞争。
    相反，它们根据在网络中的声誉（权威证明）或基于投票系统（委托权益证明）进行竞争。 无论选择的是哪种区块链共识协议，它都应该是拜占庭容错的，这意味着它应该使得分布式系统能够在一些网络节点出现故障时达成共识（即对相同的值达成一致意见）。
    换句话说，它应该能够克服拜占庭将军问题所示的问题（见[第二章](9db0c332-bdd9-4457-a708-9d8ca990e507.xhtml)，*区块链技术深度剖析*）。
    工作证明、权益证明、权威证明和委托权益证明都是拜占庭容错的协议，根据所需的去中心化程度、需要授予一些节点在网络上执行操作的权限、数据速度和可扩展性来使用。
    大多数权限区块链依赖于基于投票和抽签的共识，如权益证明和委托权益证明。
- en: This latter is an alternative version of the proof-of-stake protocol, which,
    as a reminder, elects a miner based on the number of tokens (or stake) they possess.
    Delegated proof-of-stake is often compared to a technological democracy because
    it combines real-time voting and reputation to achieve consensus. Every token-holder
    can vote to elect a validator that eventually earns enough votes to become a delegate.
    After becoming a delegate, the node can then validate the transactions and collect
    the rewards for doing so. If they misbehave, voters can withdraw their votes to
    *fire* the bad actor from validating and securing the network. Also, the voting
    power of a token holder (known as the voting weight) is determined by how many
    tokens the account is holding. This protocol benefits from a high degree of decentralization
    and enables a fast process for validating the transactions. On the other hand,
    the bigger the network, the slower it becomes as the voting process increases
    latency. Delegated proof-of-stake hence includes a trade-off between decentralization
    and scalability.

  zh: 后者是权益证明协议的一种替代版本，提醒一下，权益证明根据矿工拥有的代币数量（或权益）选举矿工。 委托权益证明常常被比作技术民主，因为它结合了实时投票和声誉来达成共识。
    每个代币持有者都可以投票选举一个验证器，最终获得足够的选票成为代表。 成为代表后，节点可以验证交易并收取相应的奖励。 如果他们行为不端，选民可以撤回他们的选票，*解雇*坏行为者，使其无法继续验证和保护网络。
    此外，代币持有者的投票权（称为投票权重）取决于账户持有的代币数量。 这个协议从高度去中心化中获益，并且使得交易验证过程变得更快。 另一方面，网络越大，随着投票过程的增加，它变得越慢，增加了延迟。
    因此，委托权益证明包含了去中心化和可扩展性之间的折衷。
- en: Regarding scalability, proof-of-authority is a better alternative. It is an
    efficient protocol for permissioned blockchains that was proposed in 2017 by the
    co-founder of Ethereum, Gavin Wood. This protocol arbitrarily identifies nodes
    that will validate transactions. These nodes are chosen based on their reputation
    to become trustworthy entities that will have the responsibility for validating
    and securing transactions. To become a node within a blockchain relying on proof-of
    -authority, a user has to undergo a tough identification process, linking their
    digital identity to their real one and disclosing personal information that prevents
    wrongdoings. The fact that proof-of-authority includes only a restricted number
    of nodes allows the infrastructure to validate more transactions (that is, increase
    the block size) and lower the transaction fees to zero. Because the nodes are
    identified, they are incentivized based on their reputation and not on an underlying
    token, which explains why most blockchains based on proof-of-authority do not
    have a cryptocurrency. This kind of consensus is favored mostly in private blockchains
    such as Quorum, which was developed by J.P. Morgan, who took inspiration from
    proof-of-authority for its consensus algorithm.

  zh: 关于可扩展性，权威证明是一个更好的选择。它是一个高效的权限区块链协议，由以太坊的联合创始人加文·伍德于2017年提出。该协议任意地确定将验证交易的节点。这些节点是基于其声誉被选择为值得信赖的实体，他们将有责任验证和保护交易。要成为依赖权威证明的区块链中的一个节点，用户必须经历一个严格的身份验证过程，将他们的数字身份链接到他们的实际身份，并披露防止不良行为的个人信息。权威证明仅包含少数节点使得基础设施能够验证更多的交易（即增加区块大小）并将交易费用降至零。因为节点被识别，他们受到声誉的激励，而不是基于底层代币，这解释了为什么大多数基于权威证明的区块链没有加密货币。这种共识在私有区块链中得到了广泛支持，比如由J.P.摩根开发的Quorum，该区块链为其共识算法借鉴了权威证明。

    transactions and contract privacy, as well as better performance in general. Quorum
    has great potential to be massively adopted by banking actors and financial institutions
    to the point that J.P. Morgan is willing to manage this activity separately from
    its banking activity. J.P. Morgan is also the first bank to deploy its own cryptocurrency,

    own blockchain. Aergo aims to become the most widespread architecture for enterprise
    application developers and to advance its usage to a mass market thanks to a user-friendly
    interface combined with a simplified administration and pre-built applications.
    The solution is cloud-based and offers the possibility to create public, private,

    of a given consortium. General hurdles in the financial sector affect transaction
    synchronization and constant truth assessment in account balances through a wide
    variety of verifications that increase delays and costs for every stakeholder
    in the process. Corda was built to overcome that by using distributed ledger technology.
    Corda was developed by R3, a company founded in 2014 that formed a large ecosystem,
    including financial companies that work together to build applications called
    CorDapps on the platform.

    information exchange on the market. Through the service, agent banks can easily
    publish detailed loan information, including credit agreements, accrual balances,
    position information, and other transaction data, and extend self-service capabilities

    because the more nodes that join the network, the lower their throughput rate.
    User experience tails off accordingly as it takes more time for the nodes to validate
    and store transactions. Corda chose to focus on privacy and security by properly
    identifying the nodes through a strong KYC to prevent misbehavior and establish
    the beginning of trust in the network. This explains why Corda is often considered
    more of a distributed ledger rather than a blockchain per se. Even though blockchains
    are a kind of distributed ledger technology, they tend to refer to trustless,
    highly decentralized, transparent, and barrier-free infrastructures. These are
    not inner features of Corda, which, however, enables seamless and private value
    transfer between peers without a supervisory body and succeeds in giving the banking

    Corda选择通过强制的KYC准确识别节点来重点关注隐私和安全，以防止不端行为并建立网络信任的开始。这解释了为什么Corda通常被认为更像是分布式分类帐而不是区块链本身。尽管区块链是一种分布式分类帐技术，但它们倾向于指代无需信任、高度分散、透明和无障碍的基础设施。这些并不是Corda的内在特征，但它使对等方能够无缝、私密地转移价值而无需监管机构，并成功地为银行和金融行业提供了一种工具，可以确保参与者之间的真相和状态同步。

    much of the code, it was expected that their solution called IBM Blockchain unveiled
    in March 2017 would make use of this specific module. This cloud-based solution
    enables developers to build robust and effective networks with improved security
    features including protection from insider attacks and an additional layer cloistering
    the registry off the cloud. Other components such as a digital identity management
    tool, a governance tool, and a shut-down option when a piracy attack is identified,
    are provided with the fully-integrated service. IBM's long-term IT expertise has
    been leveraged to offer a strong and hack-resistant cloud-based alternative empowered
    by a large group of developers, intending to offer their clients an easy-to-deploy
    solution that can support any kind of application. Maersk, Everledger, and Walmart,
    whose blockchain use cases were discussed in [Chapter 7](160a83bc-670e-4c15-9ce8-2c0d0b374684.xhtml),

    that have been making use of IBM Blockchain since its early days in 2017\. As
    blockchain is a strategic imperative according to IBM's CEO, Ginni Rometty, IBM
    took a leap in June 2019 by upgrading its Blockchain platform to enable multi-cloud
    deployments across hybrid clouds such as AWS and Azure, in order to bring the
    next level of interoperability and, of course, decentralization.

    are all enterprise-ready and open source, supported by growing communities of
    developers and organizations. Each solution was created to build on-purpose permissioned
    blockchains as an alternative to slow and hard-to-scale public infrastructures.
    The few differences we can identify between them revolve around their primary
    target and vision. While Hyperledger integrates modular frameworks such as Fabric
    or Sawtooth to suit the needs of several industries from healthcare to energy,
    Quorum and Corda are mainly finance-oriented. The large span of modules proposed
    by Hyperledger can get pretty confusing for a newcomer but have the benefit of
    meeting any kind of need for any kind of industry. Quorum and Corda, on the other
    hand, focus mainly on privacy and security issues as well as scalability and overall
    performance to enable a large number of transactions and quasi-instantaneous block
    creation. User-friendliness comes into the equation as an important criterion
    for mass adoption in the business world: Aergo, Corda, and Quorum are more accessible
    solutions than Hyperledger, whose plethora of resources, activities, training

    is that the technology evolves very rapidly and it can become cumbersome to handle
    the integration of upgrades and patches, as well as resolve scalability issues
    that can be left upto the service provider. Because these solutions are *as a

    choose and focus on how decentralized it actually is. Indeed, if you determined
    that a blockchain was the most suitable tool to answer your needs, it implies
    that the state of the digital value must be ascertained without a central entity,
    in a decentralized manner. Choosing a BaaS might sometimes go against the inner
