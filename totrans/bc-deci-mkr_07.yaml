    on a distributed and decentralized infrastructure, where full remuneration would
    go to drivers and small fees retrieved to run the blockchain and reward the nodes
    empowering the network. In fact, that is what is already developing Eva, a blockchain-based
    Uber-like startup that has truly decentralized how drivers and customers interact
    to provide car-sharing services. But the case of Uber is just the tip of the iceberg.

    The inner characteristic of a blockchain is that it is not owned by anyone and
    that it is distributed across all of the participants that work together toward
