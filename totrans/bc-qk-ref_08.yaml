    Mexican peso was worth that much. Eventually, short selling (borrowing the peso

    model of banking provides the option for the lender to avoid charging fees for
    some services. People without checking accounts because of prior overdrafts, geographic
    isolation, or high costs are cut off from this system, and generally have to resort
    to using check-cashing services and prepaid debit cards. This is another product
    that is not cheap, with services charging between one and four percent—a hefty
    sum if a worker is forced to cash his paycheck this way. For the poorest of the
    poor, after all credits, it is not unusual to pay more in check-cashing fees than
    in income tax, however hard those same people may rail against taxes.
