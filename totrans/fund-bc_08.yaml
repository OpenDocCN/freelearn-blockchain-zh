    projects. Since the invention of Bitcoin, over two thousand cryptocurrencies (referred
    to as altcoins) have emerged and have gained a lot of attention. The widespread
    use of the technology gained the attention of venture capitalists and convinced
    them to invest in projects that were mainly focused on centralized exchanges,
    wallets, or creating their own cryptocurrency solutions. The application of blockchain
    technology was mostly biased toward the cryptocurrencies until 2015, but the adoption
    of decentralized applications, with the help of blockchain platforms, created
    immense innovation opportunities in financial as well as non-financial domains.

    because the implementations were motivated by Bitcoin and Bitcoin itself was trying
    to decentralize the control of money on the internet. This influenced many developer
    communities to work on projects that were closely related to cryptocurrency. Many
    exchanges, token distribution platforms, and payment networks were created, which
    forced banking services to get directly involved so that existing banking customers
    could make use of cryptocurrency applications.

    many of the initial financial applications were cryptocurrencies, notably **Peercoin**

    of the underlying technology, and also its future scope. Although cryptocurrency
    was a great invention that made the decentralization of internet money possible
    through its P2P-based system, its true technology hadn't been exploited completely.
    Several developer communities started building applications in the Bitcoin blockchain
    to make use of the decentralization that was achieved by Bitcoin's blockchain.
    Due to scalability limitations and privacy concerns of Bitcoin's blockchain, many
    projects were created by customizing the Bitcoin implementation and forking the
    Bitcoin blockchain.

    digital identities, supply chains, asset management, and many other use cases
    to replace some of the outdated technologies. Due to the blockchain technology's
    limitations, not all the implementations were successful, but developers were
    able to find the use cases that weren't directly involved with cryptocurrency.
    This paved the way for organizations to explore blockchain technology in the non-financial
    sector. Numerous non-financial organizations that needed replacements for their
    existing technology started implementing blockchain as a solution. As a result,
    several alternative implementations of Bitcoin arose to service non-financial
    use cases.

    can be retrieved and parsed by any participant on the network. Bitcoin was created
    with the intention of decentralizing control over money. This came with a cost
    of privacy, as every transaction is public because it needed to be verified by
    the nodes on the network. This meant every transaction could be traced back to
    its origin by anyone in the network.

    need not be linked to their real identities. This prevented the account owner's
    identity from being revealed even though all the transactions were public. However,
    there is the risk of a user's entire transaction history being leaked if their
    identity is revealed. Even with these risks, transparent, publicly visible transactions
    don't cause much trouble because of pseudo-anonymity.
