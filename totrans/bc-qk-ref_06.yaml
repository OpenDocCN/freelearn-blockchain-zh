    cryptocurrencies. Also, since Bitcoin and blockchain are open source, a lot of
    people within the community started to create their cryptocurrencies offering
    similar services that provide different consensus methods and so on, in comparison

    cryptocurrencies are known as **Alternative Coins** or **Altcoins**. The first
    Altcoin was **Namecoin**, introduced in 2011\. After that, a lot of Altcoins have
    been introduced; a few of them were popular and also started to be used as mainstream
    coins, whereas others were less popular. As of now, there are more than 1,500
    cryptocurrencies in existence. There are two broad categories in the alternative
    cryptocurrency sphere. If an alternative blockchain platform is to be created,
    they are commonly called **Alternative Chains**, but if the purpose of the coin
    is to introduce a new currency, then it can be known as an **Altcoin**.

    even written from scratch. Altcoins are looking to solve some limitation or other
    of Bitcoins such as the consensus method, mining limitations, block time, distribution,
    privacy, or sometimes even adding a feature on top of the coin.

    contain the transactions that are included in the block mined. The block time
    is maintained at 10 minutes, which makes sure blocks are created at a fixed rate.
    The reward for the mining of blocks is halved every 210,000 blocks, roughly every
    four years. When Bitcoins were initially introduced, the block reward was 50 Bitcoins,
    which was halved in 2012 to 25 Bitcoins. In July 2016, the reward for mining each
    block was again halved to 12.5 coins. The next date for reducing the block reward

- en: The reason for difficulty regulation in Bitcoin is that 2,016 blocks take around
    two weeks, since block time is maintained at around 10 minutes. If it takes longer
    than two weeks to mine 2,016 blocks, then there is a need to decrease the difficulty,
    and if it takes less than two weeks to mine 2,016 blocks, then the difficulty
    should be increased.

    of two weeks. If the difficulty adjustment is more than a factor of 4, it won't
    be adjusted by the maximum factor. Further adjustment should be achieved in the
    next two weeks of the cycle. Hence, very large and sudden hashing rate changes
    take many two-week cycles to balance in terms of difficulty.
