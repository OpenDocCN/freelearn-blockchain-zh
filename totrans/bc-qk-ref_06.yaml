    cryptocurrencies are known as **Alternative Coins** or **Altcoins**. The first
    Altcoin was **Namecoin**, introduced in 2011\. After that, a lot of Altcoins have
    been introduced; a few of them were popular and also started to be used as mainstream
    coins, whereas others were less popular. As of now, there are more than 1,500
    cryptocurrencies in existence. There are two broad categories in the alternative
    cryptocurrency sphere. If an alternative blockchain platform is to be created,
    they are commonly called **Alternative Chains**, but if the purpose of the coin
    is to introduce a new currency, then it can be known as an **Altcoin**.

    even written from scratch. Altcoins are looking to solve some limitation or other
    of Bitcoins such as the consensus method, mining limitations, block time, distribution,
    privacy, or sometimes even adding a feature on top of the coin.
