    until Marco Polo introduced it to Europe in the thirteenth century. Even then,

    money was backed by precious metals (such as gold and silver), stored in a treasury
    vault somewhere, such as Fort Knox. The banknotes represented the right to collect

- en: Throughout all of these stages, we have had an idea of value in our mind, but
    it has evolved hand in hand with our civilization and technology, from something
    that you can touch and actually use; to something that you can touch, but cannot
    use (except for trade); to just an abstract idea. As you can see, the form has
    changed, but the idea of value has always remained the same, and we represent
    and communicate the idea of value in terms of money.

  zh: 在所有这些阶段中，我们都有一个关于价值的概念，但它随着我们的文明和技术的发展而演变，从你可以触摸并实际使用的东西；到你可以触摸但不能使用的东西（除了交易）；再到只是一个抽象的概念。正如你所看到的，形式已经改变，但价值观念始终保持不变，我们用货币的形式来代表和传达这个价值观念。
- en: 'This abstraction of value brings us to the next evolutionary step: digital
    cryptocurrencies, powered by blockchain technology. Similar to the fiat system,
    this form of money has value because people believe in it. But there is more to
    it than just a government promise. Promises made by people have been broken many
    times throughout history. Here, we have solid science, mathematics, and computer
    hardware, guaranteeing that blockchain works as expected. The following diagram
    better illustrates the evolution of money over the years:'

  zh: 这种价值的抽象将我们带到了下一个演进步骤：由区块链技术支持的数字加密货币。与法定货币系统类似，这种货币形式之所以有价值是因为人们相信它。但其中还有更多的东西不仅仅是政府的承诺。人们做出的承诺在历史上已经多次被打破。在这里，我们有扎实的科学、数学和计算机硬件，保证区块链按预期运行。下面的图表更好地说明了多年来货币的演变：

- en: In this new system, we have a mathematical algorithm controlling the money supply
    and putting strict limits and costs on it, similar to a gold standard. Is this
    system perfect? No; as we saw recently with the countless Bitcoin forks, having
    an open source software controlling the money supply, in a large and complex decentralized
    ecosystem, has given rise to some complicated governance issues. If every disagreement
    leads to the creation of a new version of the currency, this could lead to a lot
    of confusion.

  zh: 在这个新系统中，我们有一个数学算法控制货币供应并对其进行严格限制和成本控制，类似于金本位制。这个系统完美吗？不完美；正如我们最近看到的，随着无数比特币分叉的出现，一个开源软件控制着货币供应，在一个庞大而复杂的去中心化生态系统中，已经引发了一些复杂的治理问题。如果每一次分歧都导致创建一个新版本的货币，这可能会导致很多混乱。
- en: 'So, even though they were initially called cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and its
    digital siblings are not really currencies, as they stand now. Rather, they are
    digital commodities or assets; that''s why cryptoassets is a more appropriate
    term for them. A currency needs to be stable, in order to perform its functions
    well. We still live in a fiat world, where all transactions are denominated in
    fiat currency. Even though there are ways to pay with Bitcoin and more, they are
    still converted into fiat at the point of sale. And their exchange rate is subject
    to huge volatility on a daily basis. That''s why many electronic payment companies
    have started to issue stable coins: digital currencies pegged to a fiat currency,
    but using blockchain as the underlying payment processing infrastructure, as opposed
    to the legacy one. We''ll cover such solutions in more detail in later chapters,
    after you are more familiar with how blockchain works.'

  zh: 因此，即使最初被称为加密货币，比特币及其数字兄弟目前并不真的是货币。相反，它们是数字商品或资产；这就是为什么加密资产更适合成为它们的一个更合适的术语。货币需要稳定，才能很好地发挥其功能。我们仍然生活在一个法定货币的世界中，所有交易都以法定货币计价。即使有用比特币等支付的方式，它们仍然被转换成法定货币在销售点。而且它们的汇率每天都会出现巨大的波动。这就是为什么许多电子支付公司开始发行稳定币：将数字货币挂钩到法定货币，但使用区块链作为底层支付处理基础设施，而不是传统的基础设施。在你更熟悉区块链的工作原理之后，我们将会更详细地介绍这样的解决方案。

  zh: 总结
- en: In this chapter, you saw how the idea of money has evolved throughout history,
    from a more tangible to a more intangible concept, with each stage having its
    pros and cons. From barter trade, we moved to commodity money, through to commodity-backed
    paper money, and on to the fiat money that we use now. This was a historical journey,
    from real goods and commodities to numbers on a computer screen, representing
    value and money!

  zh: 在这一章中，你看到了货币观念是如何在历史中演变的，从更具体形式到更抽象的概念，每个阶段都有其利弊。从物物交换，我们发展到了商品货币，再到了有商品担保的纸币，最终使用的是我们现在使用的法定货币。这是一个历史之旅，从真实的商品和货物到电脑屏幕上的数字，代表着价值和货币！
- en: In the following chapter, we'll look at how the technologies underpinning Bitcoin
    emerged, and how they were put to work together. This mix of technology enables
    value, information transfers, and record-keeping in a decentralized way, without
    the need for any central agents or middlemen.
