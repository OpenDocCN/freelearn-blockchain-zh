    technology manifests, it is a good time to take a step back and go back to the
    basics. In this chapter, we'll look at the history of money. If you can grasp
    how the financial sector reached its current state, then you will better understand
    why blockchain technology is the natural next step in monetary evolution.

    one of your ranch's horses for a cow. What a good deal, right? Now, a week later,
    you go out for dinner, you finish the meal, the waitress comes over to give you
    the bill, and you prepare to pay her with a part of the cow that you got earlier!
    We can imagine that such a situation will not end well!

    trade a good or service for another good or service directly. Money is an intermediate
    commodity that is universally accepted and has a standard value for all parties.
    That's why it facilitates value exchanges more efficiently than barter trade.

    or purchasing power, over time. This eliminates any commodities or objects prone
    to spoilage or corrosion. For example, precious metals, such as gold, silver,
    and platinum, are a great store of value, as their shelf lives are essentially
    perpetual, whereas things such as milk, wheat, or iron, are not such good stores
    of value.

    Actually, they fit the bill so well that they were the primary form of money across
    the globe for centuries, and have been instilled in human culture. When we say
    gold, the first thing that comes to mind is value or wealth.

    value, as compared to precious metals. China was the first to adopt it, in the
    seventh century. However, the western world didn't catch up on this monetary innovation
    until Marco Polo introduced it to Europe in the thirteenth century. Even then,
    the first European banknotes weren't issued until the seventeenth century. It
    took people several centuries to accept the new paradigm at the time, and to shift
    from gold and silver coins to banknotes backed by the same precious metals as
    the widely used form of money.

    didn't hold any intrinsic value, such as gold and silver coins do. Instead, paper
    money was backed by precious metals (such as gold and silver), stored in a treasury
    vault somewhere, such as Fort Knox. The banknotes represented the right to collect
    those precious metals from a bank. This was more convenient than taking a wheelbarrow
    of gold bullion to the post office to pay the mortgage!

    system was introduced under the Bretton Woods agreement, which was the gold exchange

    rates to the US dollar, which was, in turn, convertible to gold, at a fixed rate.
    This system can be better illustrated by the following diagram:'

    currency, declaring it a **legal tender. **This means that a government decides
    whether a medium of payment will be recognized for financial transactions, trade
    settlement, or commerce in a country or jurisdiction.

    value characteristic of money. The key difference here is that with commodity
    money, there is a tangible resource to which the money supply can be pegged. And
    with fiat money, the money (or the quantity of money in circulation) is a much
    more discretionary subject to central banks' policies. Therefore, the margin for
    human error (involuntary or voluntary mismanagement) is larger.

    following section. However, large and leading economies, such as Germany (Weimar
    Republic, in 1922-1923) and China (1943-1945), have gone through periods of hyperinflation,
    due to excessive fiat money printing without the backing of sufficient, real economic
    resources.

    to issue a sovereign cryptocurrency. It remains to be seen how successful this

    an open source software controlling the money supply, in a large and complex decentralized

    digital siblings are not really currencies, as they stand now. Rather, they are
    digital commodities or assets; that''s why cryptoassets is a more appropriate
    term for them. A currency needs to be stable, in order to perform its functions
    well. We still live in a fiat world, where all transactions are denominated in
    fiat currency. Even though there are ways to pay with Bitcoin and more, they are
    still converted into fiat at the point of sale. And their exchange rate is subject
    to huge volatility on a daily basis. That''s why many electronic payment companies
    have started to issue stable coins: digital currencies pegged to a fiat currency,
    but using blockchain as the underlying payment processing infrastructure, as opposed
    to the legacy one. We''ll cover such solutions in more detail in later chapters,
