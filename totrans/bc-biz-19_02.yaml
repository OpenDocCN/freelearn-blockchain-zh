    technology manifests, it is a good time to take a step back and go back to the
    basics. In this chapter, we'll look at the history of money. If you can grasp
    how the financial sector reached its current state, then you will better understand
    why blockchain technology is the natural next step in monetary evolution.

    you go out for dinner, you finish the meal, the waitress comes over to give you
    the bill, and you prepare to pay her with a part of the cow that you got earlier!

    didn't hold any intrinsic value, such as gold and silver coins do. Instead, paper
    money was backed by precious metals (such as gold and silver), stored in a treasury
    vault somewhere, such as Fort Knox. The banknotes represented the right to collect
    those precious metals from a bank. This was more convenient than taking a wheelbarrow
    of gold bullion to the post office to pay the mortgage!

    money, there is a tangible resource to which the money supply can be pegged. And
    with fiat money, the money (or the quantity of money in circulation) is a much
