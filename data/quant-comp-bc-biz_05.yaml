  zh: 与戴夫·斯内林博士的采访，富士通研究员
- en: In the previous chapters of the book I provided a view on the technological
    details around quantum computing and Blockchain. I discussed use cases of these
    two technologies across different industries. I discussed how the technologies
    had several aspects in common, and there were technical reasons why I felt they
    were on a collision course. However, when we look at things from a business benefit
    perspective, we see that they are largely synergetic to each other.

  zh: 在书的前几章中，我提供了关于量子计算和区块链技术的技术细节。我讨论了这两种技术在不同行业中的用例。我讨论了这些技术有几个共同之处，并且有技术上的原因让我觉得它们彼此之间的碰撞是不可避免的。然而，当我们从商业利益的角度看待问题时，我们会发现它们在很大程度上是相辅相成的。
- en: The book's first objective was to establish the technological concepts behind
    these two groundbreaking technologies. Once we discussed that, the focus of the
    book moved on to the *so what* of these technologies. I wanted to establish that
    these technologies will have an increasingly large place in our lives over time.
    However, that is still an incomplete picture when we lack the views of those who
    are working firsthand with these technologies in order to make that happen.

- en: The first time I met Dave was at a Fujitsu-hosted event at their offices in
    Baker Street in London. Dave presented the impact of digital annealers in finance
    and logistics. After his presentation, when I was introduced to Dave, he was mentioned
    as the brains behind Fujitsu's Digital Annealer. For a minute, I thought it might
    be a long technical chat with a scientist. It turned out to be a chat where Dave
    was very eloquent about the practical applications of the Digital Annealer.

    few weeks later, and this time, I briefed Dave about my plan for the book. We
    met at the Fujitsu offices, and Dave was kind enough to provide his views on quantum
    computing in a much more comprehensive manner. The best part of the chat was when
    Dave picked up my tablet and drew a graph representing how quantum computers,
    classical computers, and digital annealers would evolve over the next two decades.

    bankrupt, as a lot of them did over the years. That was back in 1983-84\. I did

    Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). I've been at Fujitsu ever

- en: I started to work on grid computing, the predecessors to cloud computing. Towards
    the end of my time at the labs and in my transition over to the business unit,
    I was working around artificial intelligence. About 2 years ago Fujitsu announced
    its Digital Annealer. I had to school up on quantum computing very quickly, and

    but initially I came at it from the commercial side.

- en: My technical background was necessary to really understand what the challenges
    are for what I call *true quantum computing*. I was also able to address the use
    cases that the Digital Annealer could address from both a technical and a business
    strategy point of view. So, that's sort of where I've gotten to now. For the past

    salespeople from selling a product as something that it isn't (he laughs). I also
    make sure that in all our internal and external communication we are clear that

    it. Fujitsu now provides these services across multiple stages, beginning with identifying
    whether the problem is suitable for combinational optimization. We then make sure
    that the problem in hand is big enough to warrant a seriously high-performance
    solution to it. Small combinational optimization problems don't need the Digital
    Annealer. There are also some problems that are too big. We're working on addressing
    these problems in time, of course. Therefore, the process starts with identifying
    an industrial problem and then the real challenge is mapping the business problem

    stay there for however long it takes you to do that weld. Therefore, there's a

    the seam is in two dimensions you come out somewhere else in your map so it's

    Whereas the portfolio optimization space, for example, is mostly driven by the
    objective function. Typically, when you''re describing an annealing problem you
    have the objective function. Which is what you''re trying to optimize. So, when
    you''re trying to optimize for portfolio balancing, you''re trying to minimize
    your risks. Then you put two constraints against that, one is a maximum return

- en: You can also code it up as a dual objective function, in terms of a risk parameter
    that does the balance between risk and return. After this, you can constrain it

- en: In the logistics space, it's basically all about constraints. Constraints in
    the encoding process tend to explode the complexity of the problem. This is because
    you typically encode the constraint by building the quadratic terms as part of
    the problem solution. You're using part of the information space to give the code
    your constraints and so it does make it a little more challenging to also then
    use this information space to encode your objective function. In addition, sometimes
    your constraints in logistics will lead to higher order polynomials instead of
    quadratic.

  zh: 在物流空间中，一切都关乎约束。在编码过程中的约束会爆炸性地增加问题的复杂性。这是因为你通常通过将二次方项作为问题解决方案的一部分来编码约束。你正在利用信息空间的一部分来给代码添加约束，因此这使得利用这个信息空间来编码目标函数也变得更具挑战性。此外，有时你在物流中的约束会导致高阶多项式而不是二次的情况。
