    2009 surrounding the expansion of the collaborative economy triggered by companies
    such as Uber and the development of distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain. Arising
    technologies such as 3D printing, the **Internet of Things** (**IoT**), or **artificial
    intelligence** (**AI**) transform current vertical schemes toward models where value
    is shared more directly, all of this being facilitated by digital platforms acting
    as a cornerstone of the *common *pattern of the new economy.

    with producers to become *prosumers*, using renewable sources of energy to provide
    power locally and efficiently. The same shift applies for education, where knowledge
    is shared between one another, and every other industry fed with capitalism, top-down
    approaches, and oligopolistic situations.

- en: According to the author, Jeremy Rifkin, more and more companies are organized
    collectively (cooperative societies, for example). Just as a community is handled
    and managed by its members in a consensual manner, blockchain relies on the network
    to perform value transfer and information recording. The process is no longer
    descending and rigid but collaborative and flexible. Rifkin also predicts access
    to goods and services will be favored over ownership and collaboration over competition.
    The inner characteristic of a blockchain is that it is not owned by anyone and
    that it is distributed across all of the participants that work together toward
    a common truth. With this kind of mechanics, members can **cooperate in a trustless
    environment** where transparency and security are ensured thanks to cryptography.

  zh: 根据作者杰里米·里夫金的说法，越来越多的公司是以集体方式组织的（例如合作社）。就像社区是由其成员以一种共识方式处理和管理的，区块链依赖于网络进行价值转移和信息记录。这个过程不再是自上而下的僵硬的，而是协作的和灵活的。里夫金还预测，将更加倾向于使用商品和服务，而不是所有权，更加倾向于合作而不是竞争。区块链的内在特点是它不归任何人所有，并分布在所有共同努力朝着共同真理的参与者中。有了这种机制，成员们可以在一个无需信任的环境中**合作**，透明度和安全性由加密技术来保证。

- en: To answer this question, it is important to understand that the internet was
    built to exchange information. This information is copied from computer to computer,
    replicated across the network. Each bit of data that goes through a node can be
    replicated or stored. In other words, once a piece of information is injected
    into the internet, it replicates and spreads quickly through the network that
    erases its uniqueness. This is how information transmission works—by replication.

  zh: 要回答这个问题，重要的是要理解互联网是建立在信息交换的基础上的。这些信息是从计算机到计算机复制，通过网络复制。经过节点的每一位数据都可以被复制或存储。换句话说，一旦一条信息被注入到互联网中，它就会通过网络快速复制和传播，从而消除其独特性。这就是信息传输的工作原理——通过复制。
- en: 'The problem is that, in commercial transactions, we do not pass along information
    for free; we transact value that shouldn''t be replicated. If I send you a dollar,
    I''m not supposed to hold it anymore because if I did, it would be worthless.
    Hence, value should be transferred as a move, not a copy. Any kind of value, including
    money, should be involved: land titles, car registration documents, copyrights,
    exclusive contracts, or company shares. Because value cannot be spent twice, blockchain
    ensures that **double-spending** is prevented in the digital world.'

    concepts blockchain entails. From a modern currency to a digital payment system,
    we explained how Bitcoin has been playing the role of economic turmoil and how
    it now threatens some well-established public policies. We covered the main impact
    that Bitcoin is trying to achieve by giving money access to unbanked people and
    the technical limits it faces to do so. Eventually, we addressed a bigger challenge
    that blockchain can foster, the fulfillment of a more collaborative and responsible
    economy.
