    and use cases that I would be focusing on. I had a vision for the flow of the
    book, and the real-world problems I would be covering. However, through the research
    I have done over the course of writing the book, I realized there were areas that
    I should be touching upon that I hadn't planned to. The interview with Max Henderson
    was certainly serendipitous for me as an author, and something I hadn't planned

    affect one piece of the system without affecting the rest of it. There was a machine

- en: Really, you need a model that would assign a probability to every possible outcome.
    So, if you have 50 states, there are 2^(50) possible outcomes. If you are doing
    a true forecast, every potential outcome is non-zero, even though some of those
    outcomes have very low probabilities. So at the end of the day, the best forecast
    would have the ability to create accurate probabilities for all measurable outcomes
    and then sum up all those things together to give a true probabilistic forecast.

- en: The reason why that is very difficult in practice is because there's a whole
    bunch of possible outcomes, and no one wants to crunch all those numbers. People
    typically make approximations, or they will ignore the correlations between states,
    because then it's very easy to model individual states and just add up all the
    individual results. We got the idea that maybe we can map this onto a quantum
    system. While the system is in superposition, it is theoretically in all possible
    states at once. By making a finite number of samples, we might get a very good
    approximation of that full distribution of probabilities by taking advantage of
    the fundamental physics driving that system.

  zh: 实际上，这在实践中非常困难的原因是因为有大量可能的结果，而且没有人愿意计算所有这些数字。人们通常做近似，或者他们会忽略状态之间的相关性，因为这样很容易对单个状态建模，然后只需将所有单个结果相加即可。我们有了这样的想法，也许我们可以将这个映射到一个量子系统上。当系统处于叠加状态时，理论上它同时处于所有可能的状态。通过进行有限数量的样本，我们可能会通过利用驱动该系统的基本物理学原理，得到对这个完整概率分布的非常好的近似。
- en: In a nutshell, that's why we felt this is a powerful modeling approach. This
    is a very difficult distribution of probabilities to do classically, but we think
    there is a bit of a natural fit for quantum computers. Putting it on a quantum
    computer such as those made by D-Wave was an easy choice for this kind of modeling
