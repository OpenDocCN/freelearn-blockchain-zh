    Many of these highly accomplished individuals looked at technology as a silver

- en: Therefore, as a VC, one of the key focus areas for me was to look beyond the
    hype. I had to focus on the business applications and viability of technologies
    I was evaluating. In 2019 alone, I had the pleasure of looking at over 400 technology

    There are AI startups that are looking to solve this problem. We must account

    currents. We must also account for feedback loops such as melting glaciers; this
    phenomenon leads to less global ice coverage. Ice reflects the sun's rays. Therefore,
    less ice means more heat being absorbed by the Earth, which in turn melts more
    ice and so on. If we wish to model our changing climate effectively, we will need
