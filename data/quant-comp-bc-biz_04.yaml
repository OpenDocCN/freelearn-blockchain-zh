- en: The financial services industry has historically been slow in embracing innovation
    and cutting-edge technology. It is partly because banks, asset management, and
    insurance firms have seen themselves as being in the business of providing financial
    products. They have considered technology as cost centers and non-core to their
    business. However, that approach has been challenged by two key changes in the business
    landscape.

  zh: 金融服务行业在历史上一直不善于拥抱创新和尖端技术。 部分原因是银行、资产管理和保险公司将自己视为提供金融产品的业务。 他们认为技术是成本中心，不属于他们的核心业务。
    然而，这种做法受到了业务景观中的两个关键变化的挑战。
- en: The recession in 2008 saw several key shifts in how financial services firms
    interacted with innovative technologies. Banks had huge regulatory pressures after
    the recession. This meant they had to be careful about how creative they got with
    financial products they were offering to their customers. Banks had to report
    more details to the regulators about their product and service offerings. As a
    result, innovative products became scarce. There were large overheads related
    to back office technology and processes. In the UK alone, £5 billion is spent
    by banks every year on regulatory compliance. With the increase in regulatory
    pressures came a surge in risk management processes and technology.

  zh: 2008年的经济衰退导致金融服务公司与创新技术互动方式发生了几个关键转变。 经济衰退后，银行面临巨大的监管压力。 这意味着他们必须小心他们向客户提供的金融产品的创新程度。
    银行必须向监管机构报告更多有关其产品和服务提供情况的细节。 结果，创新产品变得稀缺。 与后勤技术和流程相关的大量间接成本。 仅在英国，银行每年就要花费50亿英镑用于监管合规性。
    随着监管压力的增加，风险管理流程和技术也激增。
- en: The other shift in the landscape was the rise of financial technology firms
    termed as *FinTechs*. FinTechs were innovative young companies that were using
    digital methods to offer financial services in a more customer-centric fashion.
    They were young and didn't have the burden of legacy technologies. This helped
    them create new business models, technology solutions, and operating models in

    the nimble FinTechs blindsided them. Before they realized it, banks saw their
    top line challenged by FinTechs that were growing fast and increasing their customer

    also felt Blockchain could bring them massive operational efficiencies across
    several banking processes. Blockchains are being experimented with in banks for

    there were ecosystems created on Blockchain across the world. These ecosystems
    had the potential to challenge the very fundamentals of the traditional capital

    financial services. The capital markets that we have today are highly centralized,
    disintermediated, and are often inaccessible to people that need them the most.

    the cash flow is an interest rate. The price of the bond can be calculated by

    portfolio managers make investment decisions and build portfolios of stocks, bonds,
    commodities, and other asset classes. Dynamic portfolio selection is a process

- en: Some investors prefer a high-risk portfolio with a view to getting higher returns.
    They would typically have a higher allocation of volatile securities. If the risk
    appetite is lower, there would be a larger allocation of high-grade, low-volatility

    periodically ensure that portfolio allocation is in alignment with investor preferences.

    from market participants. In that scenario, the allocation of stocks in the portfolio
    will increase due to market movement in the price of technology stocks. A portfolio

    went up. The portfolio manager would have to rebalance the allocation. However,
    an oil market spike often results in the fall of airline stocks (also held in our

    have to. I can use a traditional database and provide a version of it to each
    one of my clients. When one of them creates a transaction, I can write code to
    identify it, and trigger a copy to be written into all other databases. I would
    then build a mechanism where if one of these clients changed the records, I triggered
    an alert to the entire network about it and hope it all would somehow work as
    a framework. Alternatively, I could let Blockchain do it all for me."

    management, and several other areas where identity is critical. In the context
    of this chapter, Blockchain is currently gaining traction as a KYC and AML tool.
    As a customer, when I go to a bank to open a current account, the bank gets several
    documents from me to make sure I am who I say I am. All these documents are verified
    and stored in the bank's systems and files. Now, if I wanted to go for a mortgage
    with another bank, I must go through the same KYC processes. Sometimes, these
    processes take weeks as resources are spent to verify the identity of the customer.

    be a time in my life when I could trade the tokenized mangoes from my mangrove
    in India for tokens of Buckingham Palace. It is already theoretically possible
    using security tokens.

- en: One other key development with Blockchain in financial services is the "*Death
    of decentralization*." As the Blockchain narrative unfolded over the years, one
    of the key "*Pitches*" for the technology was that Blockchain would decentralize
    and disintermediate Wall Street. It was expected to be highly disruptive in that
    sense, and several big names from Wall Street jumped ship to Blockchain firms
    to make it happen.

  zh: 金融服务领域中与区块链相关的另一个关键发展是“去中心化的死亡”。随着多年来区块链叙事的展开，技术的一个关键“卖点”之一是区块链将使华尔街去中心化和非中介化。它被期望在这个意义上高度颠覆性，并且一些来自华尔街的大佬跳槽到区块链公司来实现这一目标。
- en: 'However, through 2018 and 2019, most events pointed to one key trend for me:
    that decentralization is a myth. Value networks cannot be decentralized as easily
    as it was initially portrayed. As the Blockchain ecosystem has evolved, we have
    seen centralized exchanges grow faster than decentralized ones. We have now started
    seeing firms like Flovtech, based out of Switzerland, who provide liquidity to
    these exchanges.'

  zh: 然而，通过2018年和2019年，对我来说，大多数事件都指向一个关键趋势：去中心化是一个神话。价值网络无法像最初描述的那样轻松地去中心化。随着区块链生态系统的发展，我们已经看到集中式交易所比去中心化交易所增长更快。我们现在开始看到像Flovtech这样的公司，他们位于瑞士，为这些交易所提供流动性。
- en: I am extremely delighted for start-ups like Flovtech, as they bring liquidity
    to small and new Altcoins listed on exchanges. However, that just goes to show
    that the decentralization drive has failed. Blockchain-driven value networks were
    once hailed as the new capital markets, however, they are just a more digitized
    and liquid version of the old capital markets. Permissioned blockchains, central
    bank digital currencies, centralized exchanges, and liquidity providers all point
    to a centralized Blockchain economy.

  zh: 我对像Flovtech这样的初创公司感到非常高兴，因为它们为交易所上列出的小型和新型替代币带来了流动性。然而，这只是表明去中心化的努力失败了。曾经被誉为新资本市场的基于区块链的价值网络，现在只是老资本市场的更数字化和更流动的版本。许可的区块链、中央银行数字货币、集中式交易所和流动性提供者都指向了中心化的区块链经济。

- en: 'The financial services industry is confronting disruption at scale from two
    key forces: regulation and technology innovation. As banks wake up to the fact
    that technology is no longer non-core to their business, they start to explore
    new ways of gaining competitive advantage. One of the key areas to achieve operational
    excellence in financial services is by using the right technologies for middle-office
    and back-office processes.'

  zh: 金融服务行业正在面对两个关键力量带来的大规模颠覆：监管和技术创新。随着银行意识到技术不再是他们业务的非核心部分，他们开始探索获得竞争优势的新方法。在金融服务领域实现运营卓越的一个关键领域是利用适当的技术来处理中间办公室和后台流程。
- en: In the past, banks and financial services firms have relied upon cost-effective
    ways of reaching optimal solutions. Be it in risk management, portfolio management,
    or any other data and computation-intensive problem, they have often traded off
    accuracy in the interest of achieving a time-sensitive, cost-effective solution.
    Where accuracy was needed, it meant that more computational power or more time
    would be required to arrive at a solution.

  zh: 在过去，银行和金融服务公司依赖于成本效益的方式来达到最佳解决方案。无论是在风险管理、投资组合管理还是任何其他数据和计算密集型问题上，他们通常在准确性和实现及时、成本有效的解决方案之间进行权衡。在需要准确性的地方，意味着需要更多的计算能力或更多的时间来得出解决方案。
- en: As the race for technology adoption was led by Fintech firms, banks have now
    shunned the legacy approach to innovation. Banks across the world, like BBVA,
    Barclays, and DBS have all taken a digital-friendly approach to please their customers.
    While that may help them with their top line, the bottom line must be preserved
    using cutting-edge technology, at viable costs.
