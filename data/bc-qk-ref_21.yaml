- en: One of the key advantages of blockchain is decentralization, which is the removal
    of any single authority to control the network. Unfortunately, this has a downside,
    which is its effect on the performance of a system. Blockchain systems work by
    keeping all the nodes of the network in sync by trying to achieve consensus so
    that every computer running a blockchain sees the same system state. More nodes
    on the network typically results in less centralization. This also means that
    more work must be done to ensure that all the network participants are in agreement
    with each other, which limits performance and scalability.

    transactions to be processed, the more processing power and network throughput
    that each node requires. As requirements go up, the network becomes less decentralized
    as fewer and fewer groups can afford to put the necessary machines on the network.

    people in that area cannot participate in the network.

    transactions; other machines on the network merely submit transactions to the
    network or observe. As well as many other performance optimizations made by the

    For instance, Bitcoin achieves approximately seven transactions a second, and
    Ethereum around 14\. A decent server running MySQL can process 10,000–20,000 transactions
