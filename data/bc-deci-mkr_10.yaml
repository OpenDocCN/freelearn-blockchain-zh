    2009 and 2014, the ecosystem was struggling to reach a certain level of adoption
    to make Bitcoin a reliable decentralized digital currency. Enthusiasts were focusing
    on trading activities, slowly discovering the underlying technology and its disintermediated
    and transparent features. The birth of Ethereum changed many things, fostering
    a stronger commitment from developers and entrepreneurs. New tools emerged such
    as smart contracts and more lately the Lightning Network. Democratization surged
    when cryptocurrencies gained worldwide media coverage spearheaded by Bitcoin's
    price rise, making emulation within the financial realm. **Initial coin offerings**
    (**ICOs**) soared and many blockchain start-ups have seen the light of day with
    several projects successful enough to compete with the world's most valuable start-ups.

    of consensus mechanisms and algorithms that require tremendous computing power

    Altering a 20-times confirmed transaction (winding back 19 blocks in the past,

    of a second because re-computing all subsequent hashes would become a piece of

  zh: 摘要
- en: As we saw in this chapter, in the coming years, it is most likely that blockchain
    will gain more and more consideration, hopefully gaining in maturity and recognition from
    governments and business leaders. Promising use cases will continue to emerge,
    eventually turning more and more into industrialized and user-friendly solutions.
    We also saw that funding will rise in importance, mostly thanks to new financing
    methods such as **security token offerings** (**STOs**), bringing the tokenization
    of financial securities to the next level. In contrast, we highlighted the emerging
    technologies such as quantum computing that could threaten blockchains supported
    by proof-of-work mechanisms, and other threats such as scalability and speed,
    which could handicap proper development of the technology.
