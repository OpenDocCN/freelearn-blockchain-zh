    meeting the needs of the populace. It is the mechanism of running a government
    using a set of principles defined in a constitution. Politics involves the art
    of governance, but is often considered to go beyond governance; it is also the
    means by which an individual or an organization establishes and enforces governance.

    model called the **Boltzmann machine** (**BM**). In doing so, they sparked the development
    of several neural networks called deep models. The BM is based on Boltzmann distribution,
    which is part of Statistical Mechanics.

    The BM is fundamentally different in that, the inputs are connected. As these
    nodes are connected to each other, they exchange information (of correlations

    a generative deep model. *Figure 2* represents the BM that has its nodes connected.

    evolution process begins. If the process is slow enough, the system should provide
    optimal results in the end state, which will also be a ground state. However,
    there is a probability that the system may not end up in a ground state. Thus,

    Blockchain. Several UN initiatives have been launched over the last few years
    that have resulted in tangible benefits in keeping track of aid, curbing corruption,
    and most importantly, ensuring accountability in the value chain.

    with financial and government organizations. Many of these organizations are based
    out of parts of the world where the regimes are hostile and corruption levels

  zh: 联合国等组织在处理金融和政府组织时面临着许多运营挑战。这些组织中的许多都位于政权敌对且腐败水平高的地区。通过透明平台有效分发人道主义援助是一个具有挑战性的过程。
- en: As a result, beneficiary data is at risk and can be a source of financial mismanagement
    and corruption if financial aid is not traced to the last mile. In order to address
    these challenges, the UN's **World Food Programme** (**WFP**) has launched a programme
    called Building Blocks. The research that backed up the core thesis of Building
    Blocks showed that the direct transfer of aid funds to beneficiaries was the most
    efficient and benefited the local economy.

  zh: 因此，受益者数据存在风险，如果财政援助无法追溯到最后一公里，可能成为财务管理和腐败的源头。为了解决这些挑战，联合国的**世界粮食计划署**（**WFP**）推出了一个名为
    Building Blocks 的计划。支持 Building Blocks 核心论点的研究表明，直接将援助资金转移给受益人是最有效的，并且有利于当地经济。
- en: However, achieving disintermediation and bringing complete transparency to the
    flow of money in the charity/aid industry is no simple feat. The UN's WFP distributed
    record cash transfers of $1.6 billion in 2018\. They needed a technology platform

  zh: 然而，在慈善/援助行业中实现去中介化并完全透明地掌握资金流动并非易事。2018 年，联合国 WFP 分发了价值 16 亿美元的现金转账记录。他们需要一种技术平台来更有效、更高效地实现这一点。
- en: The Building Blocks programme was launched in 2017 to do just that. In 2017,
    the WFP began a proof of concept in the Sindh province in Pakistan to use the
    capabilities of Blockchain for authenticating and registering beneficiary transactions. The
    technology removed the intermediaries and allowed for a secure and fast transaction
    between the WFP and the beneficiary. By 2018, the platform had over 100,000 refugees
    on board. They could get their irises scanned to prove their identities and pay
    for their groceries.

  zh: Building Blocks 计划于 2017 年启动，就是为了做到这一点。2017 年，WFP 在巴基斯坦信德省开始了一个概念验证，使用区块链的功能对受益人交易进行认证和注册。该技术消除了中间商，并允许
    WFP 与受益人之间进行安全快速的交易。到 2018 年，该平台已有超过 10 万名难民加入。他们可以用虹膜扫描证明身份并支付杂货费用。
- en: The Building Blocks platform used a permissioned version of Ethereum Blockchain.
    In a year's time, the platform was rolled out to two refugee camps in Jordan.
    The food voucher system that was in place until then, was quickly replaced with
    an iris scanning checkout for groceries and food. As the refugee information was
    integrated with UNHCR (the UN's Refugee Agency), biometric authentication was used
    to record every transaction and the beneficiary behind it.

  zh: Building Blocks 平台使用了 Ethereum 区块链的受许可版本。一年后，该平台在约旦的两个难民营推出。之前采用的食品券系统迅速被用于食品和杂货的虹膜扫描结账系统取代。随着难民信息与联合国难民署（联合国的难民机构）整合，生物特征认证用于记录每笔交易及其背后的受益人。
- en: This has saved 98% of the transaction fees in the camps. Building Blocks is
    now due for an upgrade. They are now exploring using mobile money in the refugee
    camps in Jordan. That would also scale quite quickly in providing an economic
    identity for refugees who often live and work across different countries. As refugees'
    identities are managed on a Blockchain and their transactions are registered,
    it would be easily accessible for authorities who want to understand their financial
    background.

- en: Families in need in these countries do not have to wait for weeks to receive
    their cash. In the past, they have had to depend on corrupt officials in intermediary

    reasons. However, all these parties can be disintermediated with this technology.

    然而，所有这些参与方都可以通过这项技术被去中心化。
- en: Over the last two years, I have had the pleasure of discussing this use case
    with three different Blockchain start-ups. Disberse, AidTech, and Agriledger are
    all focused on bringing accountability to charity and UN-led initiatives. Disberse

    end-to-end traceability for food produced by farmers. They are working on a prototype

- en: Agriledger have their work cut out as they attempt to add efficiencies to the
    food supply chain with the help of the UN. Farmers could own their food produce
    and logistics and other middlemen in between can offer their services and take
    a cut of the revenues. This brings transparency to the food supply chain and allows
    farmers to price their products with more information at their disposal. Customers
    buying food can also clearly trace the item back to its source.

- en: At the Singapore Fintech Festival in November 2018, Narendra Modi, the Prime
    Minister of India, delivered a keynote speech. He mentioned that start-ups used
    jargon such as Blockchain to increase their valuation with investors. Never in
    the past thirty years have I seen an Indian political leader pay attention to
    innovative trends. It may be an indication of the maturity of the Indian start-up
    ecosystem, but it is also due to the focus that the government devotes to technology

    Social media and the data that voters generate during the times of elections is
    a vital tool that can, at times, work against them. Thanks to deep learning algorithms

    their campaigns accordingly. This intelligence can also help them decide policy decisions
