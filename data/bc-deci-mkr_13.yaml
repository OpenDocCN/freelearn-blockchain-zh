    business technologies, mainly because they trigger a much cheaper and faster market
    entrance for new companies, hence strengthening competition. On the other hand,
    it is no secret that many businesses collapse due to their inadaptability to meet
    evolving demands, especially in the digital age. In the latest PwC CEO Survey
    ([https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2019/report/pwc-22nd-annual-global-ceo-survey.pdf](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2019/report/pwc-22nd-annual-global-ceo-survey.pdf)),
    28% of businesses have rated speed of technological change as an extremely concerning
    threat. Often, these traditional companies occult the fact that digitalization
    has quickly shifted the way products and services are consumed and struggle to
    leverage new technology to answer new consumption behaviors from clients and prospects.
    Blockchain is not going to make it easier for companies showing inertia on their
    path toward digitalization. Blockchain will not only contribute to changing consumption
    habits but it will also change how data flows and how value is transferred between
    economic actors, reshaping the capitalist economy in a more collaborative and
    transparent system where value is shared in a more horizontal manner. In this
    fashion, companies have a strong challenge ahead in developing a certain level
    of knowledge toward blockchain to avoid being sidelined in the coming years. But
    where can we start? In this chapter, we will approach a method to starting a blockchain
    project, address the risks and opportunities that have to be taken into consideration,
    the underlying and inevitable costs, and finally, the traps that must be avoided.

  zh: 根据 IBM 的说法，高管们往往对颠覆性的商业技术非常谨慎，主要是因为这些技术会为新公司带来更便宜和更快速的市场进入，从而加强了竞争。 另一方面，许多企业由于无法适应不断变化的需求而倒闭，尤其是在数字化时代。
    在最新的普华永道首席执行官调查中（[https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2019/report/pwc-22nd-annual-global-ceo-survey.pdf](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2019/report/pwc-22nd-annual-global-ceo-survey.pdf)），28%
    的企业将技术变革的速度评为极其令人担忧的威胁。 通常，这些传统企业忽视了数字化迅速改变产品和服务消费方式的事实，并且难以利用新技术来满足客户和潜在客户的新消费行为。
    区块链不会让那些在数字化道路上表现惰性的公司变得更轻松。 区块链不仅将有助于改变消费习惯，而且还将改变数据流动方式以及经济参与者之间价值的转移方式，从而将资本主义经济重塑为更具协作性和透明性的系统，其中价值以更水平的方式共享。
    在这种情况下，公司在未来几年中将面临着一项巨大的挑战，即发展一定程度的区块链知识，以避免被边缘化。 但是我们应该从哪里开始？ 在本章中，我们将探讨开始区块链项目的方法，解决必须考虑的风险和机遇，以及不可避免的成本，最后，必须避免的陷阱。

    are addressed, how many resources are needed, which standards should be used and
    implemented and, of course, what needs does the final product or service answer
    to. A way to push the assessment further is to analyze the firm's acceptance level
    of change and the risk tolerance level. Based on these outputs, it will become
    easier to determine a rational **return on investment** (**ROI**) to decide whether
    to invest. By identifying the potential gain according to the risk-reward premise,

- en: Before launching a blockchain project, you should also ensure that all stakeholders
    are aligned and that strong governance is in place, that is defining the roles
    and responsibilities of everyone in the network so that you can properly design
    the infrastructure. A blockchain's success mostly lies in the nodes' independency.
    One node should be sovereign over its decision to validate transaction and information
    storage; that is why governance is a real issue when it comes to blockchain. Do
    not forget that this is the network that empowers the blockchain; hence, this
    is probably the most important component to deal with.

  zh: 在启动区块链项目之前，您还应确保所有利益相关者意见一致，并确保建立了强有力的治理机制，即确定网络中每个人的角色和责任，以便您可以正确设计基础设施。区块链的成功主要在于节点的独立性。一个节点应独立决定验证交易和信息存储；这就是为什么在涉及区块链时治理是一个真正的问题。不要忘记，这是赋予区块链力量的网络；因此，这可能是处理的最重要的组件。
- en: Only then should focus be made on the design of the solution and the choice
    of the infrastructure. The proof-of-concept phase is very important because the
    technology is evolving at a rapid pace and a concrete demonstration is very useful
    for picturing the product and quantify the benefits. Evolving as an agile enterprise
    with continuous improvement and incremental releases is key to adapting to customers'
    needs. In the meantime, the enterprise should put in place the necessary organizational
    frameworks, including working groups and communication processes, so that development,
    integration, production, and adoption are sufficiently supported. Eventually,
    taking care of finance, marketing, and commerce will become mandatory if we want
    to be able to deliver the project as well as being assured that sufficient economic

    project varies a lot. Depending on what you are willing to achieve, the use of
    a certain infrastructure over another will range the investments from small to
    large. For example, the cost of authenticating official documents through a public
    blockchain will mostly comprise the transaction fees levied by the network to
    process the transactions, which is not a very expensive blockchain application.
    Using a public blockchain is sometimes the cheapest solution if we wish to benefit
    from an already existing infrastructure. Besides the transaction fees, the costs
    will mostly rely on developing the application on top of it and focusing on user
    experience.

    Facebook is doing with their Libra Project where they create a permissioned blockchain
    integrating smart contracts based on a new programming language, it might involve
    a greater deal of money. What will mostly make the total cost vary is the size
    of the network powering the infrastructure and how many users will be exploiting
    the service. Scaling up a permissioned blockchain to an inter-enterprise level

    these services to external companies whose prices are much lower, although distance
    can become a negative factor for the execution of the project. This downside can
    be, however, offset by eliminating a difficult task from the roadmap: building
    a multi-skill profiles team with R&D researchers, data analysts, business analysts,

    the final product or service. As I stated previously, attention is required for
    cloud-based solutions; however, the degree of decentralization can be reduced
    to zero for some providers offering solutions that are hosted on their own servers.

    Even though most of the solutions out there are open source and allow enablers
    to help you quickly understand mining and smart contracts, for example, there
    are inevitable steps along the way. Adopting a wider approach, the first step
    would be to choose the platform. Note that Ethereum generally makes unanimity
    and has been chosen by many companies for their project because of its dynamism
    and its large supporting community and rich documentation. Once the platform has
    been chosen, you have to initialize the blockchain, that is, create nodes and
    trigger the first block, including the choice of data velocity, transaction timespan,
    and the size of the blocks. This step can be outsourced to service providers who
    will take care of setup and configuration. Eventually, the choice of the consensus
    protocol rises and will depend on whether your project includes a certain degree
    of confidentiality and restrictions (in other words, a private network) or if
    you have chosen a public blockchain. As we mentioned previously, the use of proof-of-work
    within private networks is irrelevant because the nodes are identified and they
    do not need to compete based on computational power. As a last step, you must
    deploy your applications and smart contracts, remaining careful of the programming
    language that was used to develop them after having checked whether it is handled
    by the service provider. Do not forget that the application itself is why you
    wrote a business case and chose blockchain in the first place. Needless to say,

- en: Back in 2015 in Davos, during the World Economic Forum, blockchain was first
    mentioned as one of the six mega-trends that would contribute to the transition
    to a more digital and connected world. The report asserting this estimation was
    based on a survey of more than 800 IT executives and experts and was conducted
    by the Global Agenda Council on the Future of Software and Society. It was estimated
    that, by 2027, 10% of the global GDP will be stored on blockchain ([http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC15_Technological_Tipping_Points_report_2015.pdf](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC15_Technological_Tipping_Points_report_2015.pdf)) and
    will have important impacts on financial inclusion in emerging markets, tradable
    assets, property records, and exchangeable services and value. This was a very
    bold prediction at the time, by Victoria Espinel, president and CEO of the Business
    Software Alliance, a trade group representing the world's largest software makers,
    such as Kaspersky Lab and whose mission is to prevent copyright infringement of
    software. There's no doubt that her report was very clairvoyant as she added a
    conclusion that, if blockchain came to be widely adopted, governments would need
    to rethink their traditional mode of operation and the way they function.

  zh: 早在2015年的达沃斯世界经济论坛上，区块链首次被提及为促进向更数字化、更连接的世界转变的六大超级趋势之一。这一估计的报告是根据对800多名IT高管和专家的调查进行的，并由全球未来软件与社会议程理事会进行，预计到2027年，全球10%的GDP将储存在区块链上（[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC15_Technological_Tipping_Points_report_2015.pdf](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC15_Technological_Tipping_Points_report_2015.pdf)），并将对新兴市场的金融包容性、可交易资产、财产记录以及可交换服务和价值产生重要影响。这在当时是一个非常大胆的预测，由商业软件联盟的总裁兼首席执行官维多利亚·埃斯皮内尔进行，该组织代表了世界上最大的软件制造商，如卡巴斯基实验室，其使命是防止软件侵犯版权。毫无疑问，她的报告非常有远见，因为她得出结论，如果区块链被广泛采用，各国政府将需要重新思考其传统的运作方式和功能。
- en: Espinel's report sharply contrasts with statements that were made the previous
    year at the same event. Invited to Davos, the US Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew
    expressed his incredulity toward Bitcoin, declaring that he was making sure that
    it will not be used to finance illegal activities that have malign purposes. This
    declaration was a blatant confession of his misunderstanding of Bitcoin and blockchain.
    In fact, the decentralized infrastructure of Bitcoin prevents any authority from
    taking over the network and controlling the way value is transferred between individuals.
    Unfortunately, because of that, Bitcoin has been used as a means to purchase illicit
    products, but that was mainly true until the online global drug bazaar, Silk Road,
    was shut down ([https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/)).

    the same vein, stating that his company had nothing to do with Bitcoin because
    law enforcement will eventually put an end to it. Ironically, J.P. Morgan is now
    a leading actor in the crypto-sphere and has launched its own tokens, JPM Coin,
    and its own blockchain infrastructure, Quorum. This stark turnaround happened
    less than two years after Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a fraud and threatened to
    fire any analyst that was trading it. This is a quite intriguing behavior to say

    Coin，以及自己的区块链基础设施Quorum。这个明显的转变发生在杰米·戴蒙称比特币为诈骗并威胁解雇任何交易比特币的分析师不到两年之后。这是一个非常有趣的行为，至少可以说是如此，尤其是因为摩根大通全球区块链负责人乌马尔·法鲁克对这项技术发表了完全不同的讲话：

    companies and their business strategies and the role of technology in their growth
    path. In 2017, Tapscott founded the Blockchain Research Institute, a renowned
    independent global think-tank currently helping more than a hundred projects study
    the implications of blockchain on businesses, governments, and society. According
    to Tapscott, blockchain should not be compared to any other new technologies such
    as AI, big data, or the **Internet of Things** (**IoT**) but rather as the trigger
    initiating the fourth industrial revolution, the layer that will allow all-new
    technologies to transact autonomously in an entirely digital world.

    to actually reach production-level applicability and broad market acceptance.

    concepts and social theories blockchain involves. For public institutions leaders,
    it is important to notice that the topic has not yet been investigated, although
    the World Bank took a great leap by issuing $108 million of blockchain-based bonds

  zh: 摘要
- en: Throughout this chapter, we've underlined that identifying and understanding
    the business problem is the key to solving it because it's the best starting point
    on which to build a successful solution. We showed that, sometimes, blockchain
    was not appropriate because the solution didn't involve criteria that was mandatory
    when choosing blockchain, such as the need to store information or the alignment
    of participants' interests. But when blockchain stands as a suitable solution,
    many diverse assessments, requirements, and topics must be addressed. Among them
    is the return on investment, the regulatory constraints, or the acceptance level
    of the teams to change. Besides these open points, we tried to answer a difficult
    but necessary question regarding the cost of a blockchain, which, in the end,
    can be considered a regular IT project including specific features, especially
    when it comes to launching an ICO. Then, we discussed challenges and issues that
    must be taken into consideration, such as the consensus protocol, the degree of
    competition in the network, and data management. Eventually, we illustrated some
    opinions and statements from business executives and leaders worldwide and showed
    how diverse the perception of blockchain is between economists, politics, technologists,
    and managers.

  zh: 在这一章中，我们强调了识别和理解商业问题是解决问题的关键，因为这是构建成功解决方案的最佳起点。我们指出，有时区块链并不适用，因为解决方案没有涉及到选择区块链时的必要标准，比如需要存储信息或参与者利益的一致性。但当区块链是一个合适的解决方案时，许多不同的评估、要求和主题必须得到解决。其中包括投资回报、监管约束或团队对变化的接受程度。除了这些未决问题之外，我们尝试回答了一个困难但必要的问题，即区块链的成本，最终可以被视为一个常规的IT项目，尤其是在推出ICO时。然后，我们讨论了必须考虑的挑战和问题，比如共识协议、网络中的竞争程度和数据管理。最后，我们阐述了来自全球商业高管和领导人的一些见解和声明，并展示了经济学家、政治家、技术人员和经理之间对区块链的看法有多么多样化。
- en: As a global conclusion of this book, the key takeaway is that blockchain, just
    like big data, artificial intelligence or Internet-of-Things should be considered
    as an enabler and not as a goal. This book demonstrated all the keys for a decision
    maker or any curious business person to grasp this new technology, to understand
    its application and all the stakes gravitating around it. It was reinforced that
    blockchain was not a solution to every business issue, but rather an emerging
    computing infrastructure enabling digital value to be exchanged in a peer-to-peer
    manner without any trusted third party. With that in mind, the extent of the disruption
    in the current economy system that blockchain could bring was illustrated. The
    goal was not to praise blockchain, but rather set out all of its characteristics
    and successful stories we have witnessed in the last few years.

- en: I would like to recall that the purpose of a company in the digital age is not
    to build decentralized ledgers, connected objects or powerful algorithms. Companies
    are not judged by customers nor investors on how many digital solutions they have
    deployed, how much money they have spent to become digital-ready, or how responsive
    to change they are. Instead, a company is supposed to be able to answer specific
    business issues, reach specific business goals as well as cater to customers'
    needs in order to prosper in the digital age and keep growing profitably. As a
    decision maker it is important not to confound means and aims, that is, be able
    to draw a distinction between the objectives and the tools that will help you
    fulfill them. Innovation in general is one of those tools.

  zh: 在数字时代，公司的目的并不是构建分布式账本、连接的物件或强大的算法。公司不是根据客户或投资者评判他们部署了多少数字解决方案，花费了多少钱以适应数字化，或者对变化有多敏感。相反，公司应该能够解决特定的业务问题，实现特定的业务目标，并满足客户的需求，以在数字时代蓬勃发展并保持盈利增长。作为决策者，重要的是不要混淆手段和目的，也就是说，要能够区分目标和帮助您实现目标的工具。创新通常是其中之一的工具。
- en: The path to becoming an innovative organization can be defined in four steps.
    First, a focus should be made on standardization, that is on simplifying and documenting
    processes. Standardization does not involve any digital solutions and is only
    the precise description of processes and stakeholders. Second, the pursuit of
    dematerialization through digitization of paper-based processes will put the organization
    ready for disruption. Third, industrialization that often comes along with dematerialization
    enables reaching a continuous pace of production through the implementation of
    methods within the processes. Last but not least, implementing innovative tools
    as a final layer (whether it is robots, algorithms or blockchain) will help you
    increase speed, lessen risks and increase reliability. This mindset should be
    embraced by every C-Level executive willing to implement a new technology in their
    organization, because it requires patience and a strong willingness to transform.
