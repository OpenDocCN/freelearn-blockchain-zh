    understanding what business networks are and how they function, you'll be able
    to understand how blockchain technology can radically improve them. A blockchain,
    and in particular a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, provides significant benefits
    for business networks because it radically simplifies the information and processes
    that knit businesses together, both reducing cost and creating new opportunities
    for the businesses within the network.

  zh: 本章介绍并探讨了一个新概念——**商业网络**。通过理解什么是商业网络以及它们如何运作，您将能够理解区块链技术如何彻底改善它们。特别是，区块链，尤其是超级账本
    Fabric 区块链，对商业网络提供了重大好处，因为它彻底简化了将企业联系在一起的信息和流程，既降低了成本，又为网络内的企业创造了新机遇。
- en: We'll see how the concept of a business network allows you to analyze a business
    by looking at the counterparties with which it interacts. And although business
    networks are industry specific, a single network can be used to support multiple
    use cases, and linked to other business networks to form networks of networks.

    key terms such as **participants**, **assets**, **transactions** and **events.**
    These elements are then combined to define the behaviour of the business problem
    being analyzed. We're able to use business requirement to create a technology
    blueprint that can be used to implement the solution. By the end of this chapter,
    you'll be ready to use Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer to implement
    these ideas, which you will do in the following chapter.

    Fabric 和 Hyperledger Composer 来实施这些想法，而您将在接下来的章节中做到这一点。

    a blockchain network, you'll find it a helpful concept for wider issues such as
    performing blockchain analytics, integrating with existing systems, and how to
    structure your application and enterprise architectures. In this sense, this chapter
    can be read stand-alone without implementing a network afterwards.

    After all, businesses exist to serve individuals, don't they? Well, yes they do,
    but it's a little more subtle than that. While a business network usually exists
    to serve the needs of individual end-consumers, blockchain is a technology that
    is more valuable for the businesses in the network. That's because it allows them
    to better coordinate their activities with each other, resulting in lower costs,
    and the opportunity for new goods and services for end-consumers. That's why you'll
    hear people utter sentences such as Blockchain is more important for B2B than
    B2C, or C2C—they're trying to communicate that the big win for business networks
    is to use blockchain as a pervasive fabric for efficient and creative business-to-business

- en: Of course, individual participants are important. Businesses need to know their
    end-consumers, and often end-consumers are interacting with each other using the
    services provided by the business network. For example, if I wish to transfer

- en: While organizations are made up of individuals, they are conceptually quite
    separate to them. An organization has its own identity, and its own purpose. It
    exists in a very real sense, independently to the individuals which belong to

    individuals within an organization may change over time, and the number of individuals
    within the organization may grow or shrink, and even different roles within the

- en: The final point to note about the nature of the relationship between individuals
    and their organization is that it is individuals who perform the functions of
    the organization, as defined by the individual's organizational role. When a bank
    makes a loan to a customer, it is performed by a bank employee on behalf of the
    bank. In this way, the individuals are the agents of the organization, and an
    individual's role determines the set of tasks it can perform. For example, a school
    teacher can set a homework assignment for a student, but it requires a school
    principal to hire a new teacher. In a nutshell, individuals act on behalf of the

    And, while many devices today are relatively simple, there's no doubt that devices
    are acquiring more characteristics of being autonomous. We've all heard of the
    expected emergence of self-driving vehicles, and it's in this spirit that we introduce
    the concept of **device participants**. It may be increasingly important to think
    of these devices playing a larger role in business networks. So, while we don't

    the next concept in a business network, namely **assets**. We'll see later that

    attributes called **properties** and a set of attributes called **relationships**.
    Property attributes are easy to understand—they are the characteristics of an
    object. For example, a car has a date of manufacture, a color, and an engine size.
    Or, a mortgage has a value, lifetime, and repayment schedule. A particular asset
    is identified by a particular set of property **values**. For example, my car
    might be manufactured in 2015, be white in color and have a 1.8-litre engine.
    Another example—your mortgage might be worth 100,000 USD, have a lifetime of 25
    years, and be payable monthly. It's important to distinguish this difference—between
    the structure of an asset *in general,* its **type,** and *particular* **instance**
    of an asset.

  zh: 现在让我们重新聚焦，看看资产的结构。资产具有一组称为**属性**的属性集和一组称为**关系**的属性集。属性属性易于理解——它们是对象的特征。例如，汽车有制造日期、颜色和发动机尺寸。或者，抵押贷款有价值、寿命和还款计划。特定资产由特定的一组属性**值**标识。例如，我的汽车可能是2015年生产的，是白色的，有1.8升的发动机。另一个例子——你的抵押贷款可能价值10万美元，寿命25年，并且每月付款。区分这种差异很重要——在资产的结构*一般*、**类型**和资产的*特定*
    **实例**之间。
- en: Secondly, an asset also has a set of attributes called **relationships**. A
    relationship is a special kind of property—it's a reference to another asset!
    You can see instantly why this is important. For example, a car has an insurance
    document. The car is an object of value, and the insurance document is an object
    of value. Moreover, an insurance document names a policy holder. In our examples,
    both the subject and the object are assets, and they relate to each other in a
    way that provides essential meaning.

  zh: 第二，资产还有一组被称为**关系**的属性。关系是一种特殊类型的属性—它是对另一个资产的引用！你可以立即看出这为什么很重要。例如，一辆汽车有一个保险文件。汽车是一个有价值的对象，保险文件也是一个有价值的对象。此外，保险文件命名了一个保单持有人。在我们的例子中，主体和客体都是资产，并且它们以提供基本含义的方式相互关联。
- en: We'll see later that describing or **modeling** these relationships is an extremely
    important activity, because we're describing how the world works. In the previous
    example, we made a deliberate mistake—yes, really! That's because in the real
    world, it's actually the policy document that is central, as it names the car
    and the policy holder. In modeling, we call this an associative relationship,
    and we'll see why it's really important to get this kind of thing right. For example,
    nowhere in the nature of a car will you find an insurance document—a car is insured
    by virtue of the fact that it is named in a valid policy document. Moreover, if
    I want to insure more people to drive the car, I add their name to the policy
    document, not to the car! Much more on this later—for now, it's enough to remember
    that assets have properties and references, and particular objects have concrete
    values for these attributes.

- en: 'It''s also worth a brief mention on the nature of what makes an asset attribute
    a property rather than a reference to another asset. A simple answer is: when
    properties get too *big*, break them out into an asset reference! Of course, that''s
    a very unsatisfactory answer! Why? Because I didn''t tell you what defines big!
    A better answer is that a reference is required when a property satisfies a separate
    concern. This principle—**separation of concerns**—is a key design principle in
    any system. For example, the policy validity date is not a separate concern for
    an insurance policy, but the car and named drivers are separate concerns. This
    principle helps us to reason about insurance policies, cars, and drivers independently
    of each other, which in turn allows us to model the real world more realistically.
    Finally, on this aspect of assets, property and relationship attributes are **domain-specific**—they
    relate to the nature of the problem at hand. So, for a car manufacturer, color
    might be an attribute of a car—but for a paint manufacturer color is most definitely
    an asset type!'

  zh: 也值得简要提及使资产属性成为属性而不是对另一个资产的引用的性质。一个简单的答案是：当属性变得太**大**时，将它们拆分成资产引用！当然，这是一个非常不满意的答案！为什么呢？因为我没有告诉你什么定义了大！一个更好的答案是，当属性满足单独的关注时，需要引用。这个原则—**关注分离**—是任何系统中的关键设计原则。例如，对于保险政策，政策的有效日期不是一个单独的关注点，但汽车和命名的驾驶员是单独的关注点。这个原则帮助我们独立地思考保险政策、汽车和驾驶员，从而更真实地建模现实世界。最后，在资产的这个方面，属性和关系属性是**领域特定**的—它们与手头问题的性质有关。所以，对于汽车制造商，颜色可能是汽车的属性—但对于油漆制造商，颜色绝对是一种资产类型！

- en: It's important to understand this way of thinking about ownership, because in
    many cases we model the ownership relationship via the car, or via the owner,
    and that's sufficient for many purposes. But, the *nature* of an ownership relationship
    is an associative one, and it's important to realize this—because blockchains
    are often used to record ownership and transfer of ownership in a business network.
    For example, governments often hold ownership records—for land or vehicles. In
    these cases, the primary assets under consideration are ownership relationships.
    When a vehicle or land is transferred between participants, it's this ownership
    record that changes rather than the assets. That's important because we're often
    interested in the the history of a vehicle or piece of land, and while the vehicle
    or land itself may not change, it's ownership most definitely does. It's important,
    therefore, to be clear whether we're talking about the history of the asset, or
    the history of ownership. These kinds of history are often called **provenance**—they
    tell us who has owned an asset, and how it has changed over time. Both aspects

    life cycle**. If we consider the history of an asset, then in some very meaningful
    sense, an asset is created, changed over time, and eventually ceases to exist.
    For example, consider a mortgage. It comes into existence when a bank agrees to
    lend a sum of money to a customer. It remains in existence for the term of the
    mortgage. As the interest rate changes, it determines the monthly repayment amount
    according to a fixed or a variable rate of interest. The term of the mortgage
    may be changed with the agreement of both the bank and the mortgage holder. Finally,
    at the end of the mortgage, it ceases to exist, although a historic record of
    it may be kept. The mortgage may be terminated early if the customer wishes to
    pay it off early (maybe they move home), or less fortunately if they default on
    the loan. In some sense, we see that the mortgage was created, the term was periodically
    changed, and then the mortgage was completed either normally or unexpectedly.

    for single item of jewellery. If we were to look at the history of a large, mined
    gemstone, we would see that it underwent a process of division. The initial asset
    was a gemstone, and it was transformed into a set of smaller gemstones, each of
    which was related to the original gemstone. We can see that the asset transformation
    is homogeneous, because although the smaller gemstones are most definitely different
    assets, they are the **same type** as the original asset. A similar process of
    homogeneous transformation often occurs with intangible assets, for example, when
    a large commercial loan or insurance request is syndicated among several companies
    to diversify risk, or when a stock is split.

    In our previous example, Daisy probably got a receipt for her bicycle. The receipt

    transaction definition is implicit. Only if there's a dispute do we get to find
    out how the transaction is defined. For example, if Daisy's bicycle chain snaps
    after a couple of days, she might reasonably expect that the chain would be fixed
    free of charge, or the bicycle replaced, or she would get her money back. This

    in fact that's not the case. Firstly, every country's laws have explicit notions

    Goods Act, and it specifies the rights and responsibilities of all counter-parties
    involved in any commercial transaction. Secondly, the lack of an explicit contract
    simplifies the interaction between Daisy and the bicycle shop. Given that, in
    most cases, bicycles perform well for an extended period after purchase, a receipt
    is sufficient for most practical purposes. It would be both costly and timely

    was a dispute, there would have been other follow-up transactions—for example,
    the bicycle might have had its chain replaced, or in an extreme circumstance she
    might have got her money back. We can see that, in general, we would require several
    conditional transactions to describe a satisfactory interaction between participants
    for such a transaction. It means that if Daisy had been getting a mortgage, rather
    than a bicycle, it would have been necessary to specify several transactions and
    the conditions under which they could be executed. You've probably heard of a

    two elements to the history of an asset (or participant), namely, its current
    value, and the sequenced set of transactions that led to this value. We can generate
    the value of the asset at all points in time if we sequentially apply from an
    arbitrary point in time all the transactions that affected it. Effectively, we
    think of transaction history as a set of transaction **events** that occur at
    different times and places in the business network, thereby determining its state
    at any given point in time.

- en: We will see these two aspects of business networks explicitly expressed in Hyperledger
    Fabric via the concepts of a ledger **world state** and a ledger blockchain. The
    world state holds the latest value of an asset in a business network, whereas
    the blockchain holds the record of all transactions in the business network. This
    makes Hyperledger Fabric a little more powerful than other blockchains—like them,
    it records all the transactions in a blockchain. Additionally, it also calculates
    the current value of an asset, making it very easy to be confident that you're
    working with the the most up-to-date state. These most-recent values tend to be
    the most important because they represent the current state of the world. And,
    that's what most participants are interested in when it comes to initiating new
    transactions.

- en: We've had a tour through the world of business networks, and we've seen the
    importance of multi-party transaction processing of assets between participants—it's
    the very lifeblood of these networks. Indeed, because of the importance of today's
    business networks, a significant amount of technology is already deployed in their
    pursuit. If you've worked in IT for a little while, you've probably heard of **Business-to-Business**
    (**B2B**), and maybe even **Electronic Data Interchange** (**EDI**) [protocols].
    These terms describe the idea and technology of how businesses exchange information
    with each other. You might even have heard of, or have experience with, networking
    protocols such as AS1, AS2, AS3, and AS4\. These define standard mechanisms about
    how to exchange business data between two organizations. Don't worry if you haven't
    heard these terms—the key take-away is that business networks exist today in a
    very really sense, and have lots of technology applied to them.

- en: What does implementing a business network mean? Well, when it comes to the exchange
    of tangible assets such as cars or equipment or important documents, a blockchain
    captures representations of the assets, participants, transactions, and events
    in a business network. But, in the case of intangible assets it's a little different—in
    some meaningful sense, the increasing de-materialization of assets means that
    their representation inside a computer system is as real as the asset itself.

- en: This was the de-materialization step, and it was quite different to the other
    steps. Yes, it was cheaper, and of higher quality, but critically it stopped music
    having a physical representation. This de-materialization pattern is increasingly
    common—financial products such as bonds, securities, swaps, mortgages, and such
    are primarily represented digitally. More and more documents and forms are becoming
    digitized—from trivial examples such as airplane and train tickets, to more important
    education certificates, and employment and health records. This move towards digital
    means that the blockchain has more relevance than we might otherwise assume.

- en: So, when we implement a business network on a blockchain, we are often close
    to processing the actual assets in a business network. And, it's arguable that
    even in the case of tangible assets, the information about assets is as important
    as the asset itself! This seems like hyperbole, but think about it for a moment.
    Let's say you own a car. The car needs to have petrol, it needs to be taxed, serviced,
    and insured. It needs an annual test to make sure it is roadworthy. There's a
    lot of economic activity centered around that car of yours! Which means that the
    information about the car is very valuable —indeed, over the lifetime of a car,
    the total running costs will usually be double the cost of the car. So, maybe
    the information about the car is more valuable than the car!?

    Data Interchange** (**EDI**) protocols are only concerned with the exchange of
    information, a blockchain can store data in a ledger, process data with smart

    a holistic approach to multi-party transaction processing. In a blockchain, all
    the processing, data, and communications in a business network are accessed from
    one coherent system. That's in contrast to a traditional B2B approach where data,
    processing, and exchange are managed by different systems. This separation directly
    results in significant amounts processing to join-up information across these
    systems, and a lack of overall transparency. This process is described as **reconciliation**—it
    ensures that that there are not significant differences between the information
    at different parts of the business network—it is timely and costly.

- en: We now see the benefits of implementing a business network on a blockchain.
    Rather than a set of different systems that record assets, and different programs
    that operate on them, there is a shared view of the asset and its complete transactional
    life cycle. Blockchain provides an explicit shared understanding of the asset
    and its life cycle, of participants, transactions, and events. This shared nature
    of blockchain provides increased trust through increased transparency, and that
    radically simplifies and accelerates processing. For example, organizations don't
    have to perform periodic reconciliation with other counterparts to make sure that
    their systems tally—because everything tallies all the time, in a blockchain.

    say is that the primary beneficiaries of a blockchain in a business network are
    the participants that hold the most data, and typically that is organizations.
    It's not to say that individuals cannot host an instance of the blockchain ledger,
    but its more likely that they will be interacting with a organization that manages
    part of the blockchain. Indeed, they may not even know that they are consuming
    a blockchain. Within an organization, although it is individuals using applications
    that will be interacting with the blockchain, critically, they will be doing so
    on behalf of the organization—they are the agents of the organization.

  zh: 首先，哪些参与者与区块链进行交互？首先要说的是，在企业网络中，区块链的主要受益者是持有最多数据的参与者，通常是组织。这并不是说个人不能保存区块链账本的实例，但更有可能的是他们将与管理部分区块链的组织进行交互。实际上，他们甚至可能都不知道自己在使用区块链。在组织内部，虽然是个体使用应用程序与区块链进行交互，但至关重要的是，他们是代表组织行事的——他们是组织的代理人。
- en: Likewise, when it comes to system and device participants, it's unlikely that
    devices will host a copy of the blockchain ledger. In this way, devices are a
    little more like individual participants. In contrast, systems in the network
    can act either on behalf of an organization, or in some cases, actually represent
    the organization. What does this mean, that a system represents an organization?
    Well, if we think about a B2B system, then an organization really does appear
    to the network as its B2B gateway—for all intents and purposes, the gateway is
    the organization. It this way, we can see that it would make sense for a large
    system to be very closely allied to an instance of the blockchain ledger.

  zh: 同样，当涉及到系统和设备参与者时，设备很少会保存区块链账本的副本。这样，设备更像是个体参与者一样。相反，网络中的系统可以代表组织行事，或者在某些情况下，实际上代表组织。那么，系统代表组织意味着什么呢？如果我们想象一个B2B系统，那么组织在网络中看起来真的就像是它的B2B网关，实质上，网关就是这个组织。这样看来，一个大型系统与区块链账本实例之间有很密切的关联是有道理的。

    set of APIs than would otherwise be practically possible. However, consumers of
    blockchain APIs don''t need to worry about this—they just issue APIs, and the
    services they require just happen. The trade-off that''s occurring is that the
    blockchain infrastructure requires more coordination between the organizations
    in the business network. They have to agree on participants, assets, transactions,
    and events in advance, and how they evolve. While they can, and should, process,
    store, and communicate information uniquely when outside the blockchain, they
    must agree when it''s on the blockchain. That''s the trade-off: up-front agreement
    for the promise of radical simplification of business processes in normal running.'

    by the application according to the overall solution being developed. This application
    tier might be running in the cloud or on an on-premise system. It's where all
    the application logic for the application resides, and it is the consumer of the
    business network APIs provided by the blockchain. This application may be doing
    other work, such as accessing a database, or performing analytics—but from our
    perspective, it's the interaction point with the blockchain network. It consumes
    the blockchain APIs, not the end-device. Summarized, these APIs operate within
