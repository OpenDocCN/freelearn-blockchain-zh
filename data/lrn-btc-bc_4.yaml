    key to unlock its Bitcoin outputs or its value. Bitcoins are stored in wallets.
    These wallets are collections of public and corresponding private keys, where
    the public keys are represented by the Bitcoin address. If your Bitcoins are not
    at a Bitcoin address that you directly control, they are not under your control
    at all. It is said that if you do not have the keys, you do not have control of
    the Bitcoins. Basically, you only own the Bitcoins when you own the corresponding
    private keys. If a third-party obtains one or more of the private keys that are
    saved in your wallet, they can use any coins previously received by that public-private
    key pair or combination. Such a transaction doesn''t have to be made using your
    wallet. It can be brought into any device, from anywhere. This is a design feature
    of Bitcoin that allows, among other things, the ability to import and export addresses
    between wallets. This is as good as your credit card PIN. You certainly do not
    want to let an unknown person know your PIN.'

    space of time. Well, Bitcoin is fairly uncontrolled and nobody will come to your
    rescue when your savings are lost. This is an important part and an added security
    part for cryptocurrency investors. It is to do with two-factor authentication.
    It is necessary that investors use wallets and exchanges that force **two-factor
    authentication** (**2FA**). This needs a user to confirm their identity with more
    than a simple password. Users need to use fingerprints, knowledge of personal
    data, or validation from a secondary device to utilize 2FA, and this feature should
    be enabled by all users. While this may delay the login time, it may save you
    from an expensive hacking crisis. Remember that 2FA cannot secure access to your online
    account, but it can act as a tollgate while carrying out any purchases or sales
    involving coins.

- en: '**Back it up**: Due to the breakdown of your computer or mobile phone, access
    to your coins is not possible. Coins that cannot be accessed are treated as lost
    forever. Backups are a must when handling important data, especially when the
    data is something to do with your money or cryptocurrencies. This is something
    that should be naturally followed. A good backup strategy is your safety net against
    the loss of your Bitcoin wallet due to hardware drive failures or natural disasters.
    If your hardware drive dies or if your computer is lost or stolen and you don''t
    have a backup of the Bitcoins, they are gone. You can check with your wallet service
    provider or software about which files to back up. A good strategy is a **3-2-1
    strategy**. Number **3** is three backups on two different media devices, such
    as an external hard drive or a USB flash drive; number **2** is to store them
    on your paper wallet; and finally, number **3** is to store them at a remote location
    or your friend''s house. This 3-2-1 strategy has often helped people to prevent
    their cryptocurrencies from being stolen. If a wallet offers protection for your
    password, ensure that you use it. This feature conceals a wallet file, that is,
    the `file.dat` file, or something that is the same as the `file.dat` file, which
    stores private keys and any metadata that may harm your privacy if leaked. Even
    if an attacker tries to hack into your computer and gets access to the file, it
    will be of no use as it is encrypted and cannot be used without the password.
    A word of caution: use a strong password that is difficult to assume or crack.
    The **Hierarchical ****Deterministic** (**HD**) wallet uses the HD or VIP protocol,
    in which a backup has to be performed once, which consists of 12 or 24 human readable
    words that you can write down and keep in a secure place. Daily backups are not
    needed and whenever you want to restore your wallet, it will ask for these words
    in the exact same sequence.'

  zh: '**备份数据**：由于计算机或手机故障，无法访问你的货币。无法访问的货币将被视为永久丢失。在处理重要数据时，尤其是涉及到你的钱或加密货币的数据时，备份是必不可少的。这是一个应该自然而然就要遵循的事情。一个良好的备份策略是你针对硬件故障或自然灾害丢失比特币钱包的安全网。如果你的硬盘损坏，或者你的电脑丢失或被盗而你没有比特币的备份，它们就会丢失。你可以向你的钱包服务提供商或软件咨询应该备份哪些文件。一个好的策略是**3-2-1策略**。**3**表示在两种不同的介质设备上备份三次，比如外部硬盘或者USB闪存驱动器；**2**是将它们存储在你的纸钱包上；最后，**1**是将它们存储在远程地点或你朋友的家里。这种3-2-1策略通常帮助人们避免他们的加密货币被盗。如果一个钱包提供了密码保护，确保你使用它。这个功能会隐藏一个钱包文件，也就是`file.dat`文件，或者与`file.dat`文件相同的文件，其中存储了私钥和任何可能损害你隐私的元数据。即使攻击者试图黑入你的电脑，并且获得了文件的访问权限，也无济于事，因为它是加密的，没有密码就无法使用。需要注意的是：使用一个难以假设或破解的强密码。**分层确定性**（HD）钱包使用HD或VIP协议，只需进行一次备份，其中包括12或24个可阅读的单词，你可以写下来保存在安全的地方。不需要每天备份，每当你想要恢复你的钱包时，它会要求你按照完全相同的顺序输入这些单词。'
- en: '**Better to go offline or cold**: If you will not use your cryptocurrency for
    a long time, say a few months or a year or two, you need to keep your currency
    safe and prevent easy access. You can use offline wallets, as these are the most
    secure storage, where private keys are both developed and reserved offline. This
    greatly reduces the danger of coins being stolen by hackers or malignant software.
    Find the cold storage solution that is suitable for you. If you plan on holding
    a small amount of Bitcoins for any length of time, say three months or more, the
    best thing to do is to move them offline and off your computer. A paper wallet
    is a piece of paper with a private key engraved on it, and it is usually in the
    form of a QR code. Some paper wallets can be printed, so you can record your balance
    without importing the private key to a different wallet. You can securely develop
    a paper wallet and keep it safe in your personal vault. Payment for products and
    services that are offered by the site are not needed. Next is the hardware wallet—they
    are tiny devices or smart cards that can be connected to your computer, phone,
    or USB. This type of wallet is generally the most securely guarded because the
    private keys are stored offline and they never leave the device at all. Funds
    can be sent by users from their hardware wallets to exchange and trade them. At
    the same time, it ensures security for the bulk of their investments. **Trezor**,
    for example, is a hardware wallet that provides a high level of security without
    sacrificing convenience. Another benefit is that Trezor can sign a transaction
    while connected to an online device. That means spending Bitcoins is safe even
    when using a compromised computer.'

  zh: '**最好离线或冷藏**：如果您长时间不使用您的加密货币，比如几个月或一两年，您需要保护您的货币安全，并防止轻易访问。您可以使用离线钱包，因为这些是最安全的存储，私钥都是离线开发和保留的。这极大地降低了硬币被黑客或恶意软件盗取的危险。找到适合您的冷藏解决方案。如果您计划长期持有少量比特币，比如三个月或更长时间，最好的方法是将它们转移到离线状态并远离您的计算机。纸钱包是一张印有私钥的纸片，通常以
    QR 码形式呈现。一些纸钱包可以打印，因此您可以记录您的余额而不需要将私钥导入到其他钱包中。您可以安全地生成一个纸钱包，并将其安全地放置在您的个人保险库中。网站提供的产品和服务无需付费。接下来是硬件钱包——它们是可以连接到您的计算机、手机或
    USB 的小型设备或智能卡。这种类型的钱包通常是最安全的，因为私钥是离线存储的，并且根本不离开设备。用户可以从他们的硬件钱包向交易所发送资金并进行交易。同时，它确保了他们大部分投资的安全性。例如，Trezor
    是一种硬件钱包，提供了高水平的安全性而不牺牲便利性。另一个好处是，Trezor 可以在连接到在线设备时签署交易。这意味着即使使用了受损的计算机，花费比特币也是安全的。'
- en: '**Diversify your storage**: Diversification is always a way to mitigate risk.
    Based on your trading pattern and the amount of coins you trade daily, weekly,
    and monthly, you can store your cryptocurrencies in different wallets. You can
    use a number of wallets such as on desktops, mobiles, or even an offline wallet.
    In general, your largest stock can be stored in a hardware wallet, which is more
    secure. You can alternatively store it in a paper wallet and secure this paper
    in your personal vault. Some coins can be stored in your desktop or HD wallet,
    while a small amount of coins can be stored online for regular trading purposes.

  zh: 为了解释硬件钱包的工作原理，让我们举个例子。
- en: We will take as an example the **Ledger Nano S** wallet, which is a well-known
    hardware wallet. You can see the diagram or the picture of the wallet that comes
    with a USB extension and can be connected to laptops or computers. When the ledger
    device turns on for the very first time, it uses an algorithm to figure out how
    to use a set of 24 regular words to get a seed. They are usually words with letters,
    for example, four to five letters, which form one word. Basically, there are words,
    which will be randomly picked up, and it produces a seed. Keys for wallets are
    generated from the seed.

  zh: 我们以**Ledger Nano S**钱包为例，这是一个著名的硬件钱包。您可以看到带有 USB 扩展的钱包的图表或图片，可以连接到笔记本电脑或计算机上。当账本设备第一次打开时，它使用算法来确定如何使用一组
    24 个常规单词来获得种子。它们通常是带有字母的单词，例如四到五个字母，组成一个单词。基本上，有单词会被随机选中，然后生成一个种子。钱包的密钥是从种子生成的。
- en: It also specifies a way to annex these 24 words with an additional passphrase,
    which counts as word number 25\. If no passphrase is selected, an empty one is
    used. So, it is necessary to always have the 24 words plus one passphrase, which
    could be empty. Also, remember that a passphrase is different from the passwords
    that we use in various applications as well. A valid seed is produced when any
    passphrase is combined with 24 words. It is advisable that the user writes these
    24 words down on a piece of paper, usually the one that comes in the box with
    the ledger, and keeps that paper safe and away from the ledger itself. For example,
    let's say you have jotted down the four or five digit PIN of your credit or debit
    card, and you keep the paper along with the debit card or credit card; it is highly
    possible that someone can get access to your card and the paper, and then get
    full access to your account. To ensure that this breach doesn't take place, it
    is advisable to keep the paper on which you have written your PIN away from the
    card itself.

  zh: 它还指定了一种将这 24 个单词与附加密码连接起来的方法，该密码计为第 25 个单词。如果没有选择密码短语，则使用空密码。因此，始终需要 24 个单词加一个密码短语，它可以是空的。此外，请记住，密码短语与我们在各种应用程序中使用的密码不同。当任何密码短语与
    24 个单词结合时，将生成一个有效的种子。建议用户将这 24 个单词写在一张纸上，通常是与账本一起附带的那张纸，并将该纸安全地放在远离账本本身的地方。例如，假设您已经记下了信用卡或借记卡的四位或五位数字
    PIN，并将该纸与借记卡或信用卡放在一起；很有可能有人可以访问您的卡和该纸，然后完全访问您的账户。为了确保不会发生此类违规行为，建议将写有 PIN 的纸与卡本身分开。
- en: Now, this developed seed number is used to produce a root key, which is a mix
    of letters and numbers that cannot be predicted. Every blockchain of cryptocurrency
    has its own method of producing the root key from the seed. This key is then used
    to develop a number of private keys that then become cryptocurrency wallets for
    the cryptocurrency blockchain, which the user is keen on. In addition to that,
    the ledger device then requires the use of a PIN, which can be a combination of
    four to eight digits. This is an additional measure taken to safeguard the device.
    However, if the PIN is wrongly logged in three times in a row on your sequence,
    the ledger device automatically destroys all the data, making it useless to anyone
    who has access to it.

  zh: 现在，这个发展出来的种子号用于生成根密钥，这是一组字母和数字的组合，无法预测。每个加密货币的区块链都有自己的方法从种子生成根密钥。然后使用此密钥开发多个私钥，然后成为用户感兴趣的加密货币区块链的加密货币钱包。此外，账本设备还需要使用
    PIN，可以是四到八位数字的组合。这是采取的额外措施来保护设备。但是，如果在您的序列上连续三次错误输入 PIN，账本设备将自动销毁所有数据，使其对任何有权访问的人都无用。
- en: If the ledger gets destroyed, stolen, or lost, the question arises about how
    the user can get access to the keys, the wallet, and the currency in it? The original
    owner of the device can then use the words on the piece of paper to restore its
    contents, either on a backup ledger, another ledger, or any software wallet, thus
    regaining all funds and addresses. This is possible because all we need to do
    is develop the root key, the 24 words, and the passwords, if provided when creating
    the words in the seed.

- en: '**Mid-term**:Coins that are the subject of speculation as to whether they will
    grow or not are called mid-term coins. You can consider such coins as worth investing
    in for a few weeks, or more as a mid-term investment. These could include Bitcoin
    Cash, Zcash, Zcoin, and ICOs, for example, and many other Altcoins. One can also
    think of making an early investment in some of the ICO crowdfunding. An ICO is similar
    to an **initial public offering** (**IPO**), the term used in equity markets,
    shares, and trading. There''s a word of caution here. One must do thorough research
    on any particular ICO before investing in it. Visit company websites for the product,
    understand what offers they have and read the white papers they have probably
    published. At times, it is worth doing research on the founding members themselves,
    such as how much credibility and experience they bring to the industry. Also,
    check whether they have ICO ratings provided to them by individual third-parties.
    Most importantly, one must know when to exit from ICOs. What is advisable is that
    one must buy the ICO when it is published in the market and hyped and sell those
    when they list in publish exchanges, making a margin difference gain. One more
    thing to remember would be that not putting more than 5% of the overall portfolio

    investments. This is the most exciting way to use coins. Those with low risk appetites
    can use the short-term arbitrage method, but then it is better to avoid ICO investment.

    This is a good website to use to stay updated as to what is going on in the crypto
    world and find out more about your investments. It is said that an idea's or a
    technology's life expectancy is proportional to its age. This concept is called
    the **Lindy effect**. Let's take an example of a best selling book published in
    2017, and let's compare it to the Bible, which has been around for over 300 years
    now. If you are asked about which book is more likely to still be in print in
    the next 100 years, the answer would obviously be the Bible, as it has a higher
    probability of survival. It has nothing to do with the contents of the book, it
    is just simple math. An idea that has survived for such a long period of time
    is and will likely continue in the same trend. A new book's contents might be
    relevant in today's world, but who is to really know if the hype will decline
    or reduce? The true test of any idea or technology is its survival over time.
    If the same is applied to Bitcoin, we can say that the longer Bitcoin survives,
    the stronger the idea of decentralized cryptocurrency becomes. If you look at
    ATM machines, they have been time-tested over a period of several decades, and
    now they are a mainstream asset. The same applies to the cryptocurrency world.
